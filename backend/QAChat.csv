Question,Answer
Can I create an open access journal through the University of South Carolina Libraries?,"## Create and Manage Open Access Journals
The University of South Carolina Libraries offers software and support for the creation and management of open access journals. The library uses [Digital Commons software to host journals](https://www.bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/managing-publishing-journals/). Benefits of using this software include support for all types of content, search engine optimization, access to detailed analytics, and flexible peer-review workflows.
USC affiliated faculty are eligible for free journal hosting and support. Before launching a new journal, youâ€™ll need to carefully consider the details of your journal, including people, policies, content, production, design, workflow, and sustainability. In most cases, you'll be asked to sign a memorandum of understanding with the University Libraries to delineate expectations and responsibilities.

What details should I consider when creating an open access journal?,"## Details
- Is this title already in use? Check [WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/) and [Ulrichsweb](https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://www.ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com) to confirm that the title is available. Make sure that the title is clear and can be abbreviated.
- The library will provide a consultation to help you create a landing page for the journal. You will need to provide a color scheme and a banner or cover photo. You should also consider if you will need to create issue covers and images within the journal. You may wish to consult other [journals published through Digital Commons](https://www.bepress.com/categories_jnl/all-journals/) as examples of what is possible.
- What subject areas and topics will the journal cover? What is the purpose of the journal? Are there existing journals with similar content? If so, what will make this journal unique? Who is the intended audience of this journal?
- What types of materials will be accepted? Only research articles, or will you allow reviews, opinion pieces, videos, etc.? How will you solicit quality content over an extended period of time?
- How often will issues/articles be published? Will articles be published as received or bundled as issues?
- Will you [assign DOIs](https://www.doi.org/) to content? Digital Commons does not automatically assign DOIs, but USC Libraries is a [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) member and can work with you to incorporate a DOI assignment workflow. The Libraries will be responsible for the cost of registering current content. If you would like to assign DOIs to backfiles, you will be responsible for the cost.
- Journal indexing will make your journal and its content more discoverable. All new journals are required to obtain an ISSN. Once you have an ISSN, register with [Ulrich's Periodical Directory](https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://www.ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com) by emailing [ulrichs@proquest.com](mailto:ulrichs@proquest.com). In the email, include the journal name, publisher name (University of South Carolina Libraries), and any other relevant details. Read the [FAQs](http://www.ulrichsweb.com/ulrichsweb/faqs.asp) for more details. If your journal meets the [criteria](https://doaj.org/publishers#applying), register it with the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/application/new). Check [Google Scholar ](https://scholar.google.com/) to see if your journal appears. If it does not, [register it](http://www.google.com/support/scholar/bin/request.py). There will be additional indexing opportunities dependent on your discipline. You will likely be familiar with the databases used heavily in your field. Each will have different policies and procedures that are typically available from their website.
- What is your expected timeline? Plan on allowing one or two years of preparation time for the first journal issue to be released. When would you like to issue the first call for papers? What is your target date for the first issue?

What roles are needed to manage an open access journal?,"## Managing Open Access Journals
## People
- Who will serve as journal manager, the person who is primarily responsible for this journal during the planning stages and after the journal has launched?You will likely need a managing editor to create and publish journal issues, monitor submissions, and assign peer-reviewers. You may  need section editors to manage specific articles. Additionally, you will need production staff who handle tasks such as copyediting, layout, and proofing. You'll also likely need an editorial board, authors, and reviewers.While there certainly can be overlap in these roles (for example, you may choose to ask your editorial board to act as reviewers or content shepherds) and you don't necessarily need to have names in place to start the journal creation process, keep in mind tht these roles will continue to be necessary throughout the life of the journal. You should have an idea of how you will recruit participants.We recommend that you establish documentation detailing responsibilities and terms for each of these roles.

- How will you recruit and train new board members and staff? How often will turnover take place? Do you have an idea of how long you will retain primary responsibility for the journal and who will replace you if you can no longer act as the journal manager?

[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/new)"
What policies should be established for an open access journal?,"## Policies
- How will submitted manuscripts be considered for inclusion? How will manuscripts be checked for plagiarism and/or copyright violations?

- What kind of review will each submission require? Describe the procedure in detail, including the peer review process and reviewer guidelines if applicable. Digital Commons includes[workflow procedures for peer review](https://www.bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/3150/), but you should have an idea of what type of peer review is appropriate for your journal.Who will be involved in the peer review process?

- All journals will be available open access immediately upon publication if hosted through the University of South Carolina Libraries. The open access policy should be clearly stated on the journal's webpage and on author submission agreements.

- Who will hold the copyright for submissions? Many open access journals release content under a Creative Commons license.[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)has a selection tool for picking an appropriate license.Develop preliminary public statements for copyright policies, including rights, usage, attribution, and exceptions. You may wish to consult other journals in your field or[published through Digital Commons](https://www.bepress.com/categories_jnl/all-journals/)as examples.In the event of a copyright infringement claim or other legal challenge, USC Libraries may require the journal to remove the offending content from the journal.

What should I consider when planning a digital scholarship project?,"## Plan your Project
Creating digital scholarship can take years of research, planning, and coordination, which is why it's important to create a project plan and timeline as early as possible. While your plan may evolve and need to be updated over time, it's a good idea to use it as a guide to stay organized. Here are some factors to consider:
- What is the primary purpose of your project? Think of a way to describe your project in two or three sentences. This abstract can be used to pitch to funders or to communicate with your intended audience and peers.

- Who will the audience be for your project? In most cases, it's available on the web, it will be available to anyone, but who would be most interested in your site? Consider how others might use or reuse your content.

- Digital scholarship projects often, but not always, involve collaboration. Will you need to work with others, and if so, what roles will they play?

- What content management system (CMS) or platform would be the most effective for hosting your project? Do you already know how to use the CMS, or do you need training or assistance? Are there any preliminary or ongoing costs associated with your CMS of choice? For more information on choosing a CMS and the options available to you, visit[Content Management Systems.](https://sc.libapps.com/libguides/admin_c.php?g=943207&p=6798782)

- What types of digital tools will you need beyond the CMS? If you plan to incorporate visualizations, annotations, maps, timelines, databases, or other types of digital content, you will need to be able to select and use these tools. Learn more from[Digital Tools](https://guides.library.sc.edu/digitalscholarship/tools).

- Where will you store your master files and data? Many CMS have limited storage space available. The Libraries may offer storage options for different uses. Your University affiliation may effect your storage options, so consider if you will continue to need to host the content over a short time period or many years.

- Good metadata, or information describing the various aspects of your project, is essential for helping users locate and access your project. How will you describe the files, pages, and other content included on your website? Some platforms, like Omeka, make it easy to incorporate metadata throughout your project.

- You'll need to consider both your copyrights and the copyrights of others as you develop your product. Just because you've published your materials on the web doesn't mean that they aren't copyrighted. Consider[assigning a Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)to your works to grant users specific permissions for using your works. You'll also want to carefully consider if and how you reuse the copyrighted works, including text, videos, images, etc., of others.[Learn more about copyright, permissions, and licensing](https://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright). If there are privacy concerns, make sure they are addressed before publishing content.

- Your project isn't finished once it's available online. Your website will need to be maintained and updated regularly. If your hosting service relies on funds or institutional credentials, consider how you might maintain access after your initial funding expires or if you leave your institution. If you remove the website, consider archiving your site for your own or external purposes. Explore our[Web Archiving](https://sc.libapps.com/libguides/admin_c.php?g=943207&p=6798779)page for more information.

- Consider how you will promote and share your project. You may want to share your project through relevant teaching and scholarship Listservs, a[scholarship](http://guides.library.sc.edu/openaccessresources/repositories)or[teaching](http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/createOER)repository, or through social media.

- Are there funding opportunities available to support your project? Many organizations offer grants and other forms of funding for digital scholarship projects. [Learn more about funding opportunities](https://neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants).

[Visualizing Objects, Places, and Spaces: A Digital Project Handbook](https://handbook.pubpub.org/) is a great resource for those interested in creating a digital project. It offers thorough, practical guidance from planning through implementation.

What is copyright and why does it exist?,"## Copyright Basics
Information and educational tools on this website are offered to assist faculty, staff, and students of the University in making good decisions about the appropriate use of copyrighted materials.

The Copyright Law (Title 17 of the US Code) exists to grant certain rights to content creators. It allows them the control over copies, derivative works, public display, public performance, and transmission of their works. Copyright law attempts to balance the need to establish incentive for content creators to profit from their work, and thus have incentive to continue to create, with the additional need for society to have some rights to these works such as the right to criticize, parody, and use for education.  Although we do, as educators, have specific exceptions granted to us through this law, we still have obligations to meet so that we ensure that the rights of those who created the content are protected.

Copyright covers any original work put in a tangible medium. This includes digital works (webpages, graphics, email, etc.), photographs, and computer software. It does not cover works of expression that are not in a tangible form (i.e. ideas, names, titles, concepts, or improvised performances that aren't recorded) and works in the public domain.

[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright)"
How do I make copyright decisions?,"## Making Copyright Decisions
  Is the work covered by copyright or could it be part of the [Public Domain](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/publicdomain)? 
Ideas, facts, processes, and concepts cannot be copyrighted.  Works must meet a minimal level of originality to be able to be copyrighted.  Many works are in the public domain, which means they are free to be used by all.  [Learn more about the public domain.](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3629780)
      Is there an [Exception](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/exceptions) that allows me to use this work?
Take a look at the [special exceptions](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3629781) written into the copyright law by congress to help support teaching and scholarship.  These exceptions may make your use of copyrighted material legal.
      Is the work covered by a [License](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/licensing) that would allow you to use it? 
[Find out more](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/licensing) about the creative commons, databases the library purchases for your use, as well as your obligations to uphold licenses.
        Could the use be a [Fair Use](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/fairuse)? 
[Find out more](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3630697) about this important doctrine written into the copyright law to allow society certain rights to use copyrighted materials.
        How can you obtain [Permission](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/permission) to use a protected work? 
If the work is protected by copyright and your use of the work is not covered by an exception, you can ask the copyright holder for permission to use the work. [Find more information](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/permission) about seeking permission to use copyrighted material.

What are the types of repositories for sharing research?,"## Types of Repositories
Sharing your previously published research can[ increase its visibility and reach](https://sparceurope.org/what-we-do/open-access/sparc-europe-open-access-resources/open-access-citation-advantage-service-oaca/oaca-list/). It's important to understand the differences in the types of repositories to determine which is most appropriate for sharing your work. While there is some overlap between repository types, the three main types are:

Institutional repositories (IRs) are repositories that are hosted and managed by educational institutions. They exist to preserve and share the scholarly output of an educational institution. [Scholar Commons](http://scholarcommons.sc.edu) is the institutional repository of the University of South Carolina. It can be accessed from [http://scholarcommons.sc.edu](http://scholarcommons.sc.edu). 

Disciplinary repositories, sometimes known as subject repositories, are digital archives for subject-specific scholarly output. Some scholars choose to share their works through disciplinary repositories to increase the visibility of their work among subject experts and possible collaborators. Some disciplinary repositories rely on author generated content, while use web crawlers to locate and download publicly available content for inclusion. To find a disciplinary repository to share your work, visit the [Disciplinary Repositories Wiki](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Disciplinary_repositories) for a comprehensive list organized by subject.

Multidisciplinary repositories archive and make available works across multiple disciplines.

What version of my work can I share?,"## What Can I Share?
It can be tricky to know which version of your work you can share. It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works. But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which? Visit the [Which Version Can I Share? ](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/sharing)page for an overview of pre-prints, post-prints, publisher PDFs and for information on how to locate these records. Sharing the legally-allowed version of your research protects your works from being taken down.

What are academic social networking sites?,"## Social Networking
Social networking sites for academics, such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate, are used by some researchers to share their scholarly works and monitor analytics across disciplines. These sites are often used as social media and outreach tools. Because these types of sites have been regularly accused by publishers of [massive copyright infringement](http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/), it's important that researchers pay close attention to the terms of service and privacy policies of these sites.

How do I create an Open Educational Resource?,"## Creating OER
Creating an OER is similar to authoring any other document, except that you are assigning that content an open license which usually allows for its free use and re-purposing by others. 
Things to consider:
- What license will you assign to your OER? Using a[Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)will provide you with the legal framework to share your OER.
- How will you make your OER accessible to all students? We recommend the[Open Education Consortium's guide](http://www.oeconsortium.org/resources/toolkits/accessibility/)to addressing accessibility issues.
- Where will you create and host your OER? There are sites available from which you can directly upload and share your materials, and there are educational repositories designed specifically to assist with the creation and hosting of OER. For more information on creating and hosting OER, visit the section titled[Sites for creating and hosting OER](http://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=410356&p=3732812#s-lg-box-wrapper-13612726).
- How will you share your OER? Once you've created your OER, you may want to share it across many directories and repositories for maximum visibility. Consider submitting your work to[MERLOT](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm),[OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/), or the[Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/).

How do I modify an existing Open Educational Resource?,"## Modifying OER
Modifying an existing OER is a a simpler way of adopting content to suit your needs than creating a new OER. Before modifying an OER, check that the Creative Commons license does not contain a no derivatives clause. If it does, you do not have permission to modify the work. Search for formats that are conducive to modification, such as .docx and .rtf. Once you've downloaded and modified the OER, you can upload it to many of the sites listed in the [Sites for Creating and Hosting OER](http://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=410356&p=3732812#s-lg-box-wrapper-13612726) section.

What types of works can be copyrighted?,"## What Can Be Copyrighted?
Not everything created can be copyrighted. One important aspect of copyright law throughout history is that ideas and facts cannot be copyrighted.  For example, you may write a book about capitalism. The words you use to express your idea may be copyrighted; however, you cannot own the idea of capitalism. Ideas belong to our culture.
There is a minimal standard of originality that must be met for works to be protected by copyright. For example, if you were to take a picture of the Mona Lisa, it is a replication of the original. You cannot copyright that picture because it adds nothing original. However, if you were to add to the photo by changing the colors or other artistic elements, you might be able to copyright that image. Lists that lack originality, such as the white pages of a phone book, typically cannot be copyrighted because they do not meet the standard of minimal original content.
Also, facts and processes cannot be copyrighted. For example, a recipe for cheesecake with a list of ingredients, and instructions on how to bake the cake is not copyrightable. However, if you were to include stories of the person who created the recipe, or suggestions for ways to serve it, then that content would be copyrightable.

What is the public domain?,"## What is the Public Domain?
A work in the public domain is not protected by copyright. The public domain is important to us as a culture. Allowing people to create using other people's ideas and works helps us remain an innovative and progressive society. Many important works are in the public domain. Some include:
- works published before 1927
- works where copyright has expired
- most federal documents
- facts, titles, ideas, etc.
What is actually in the public domain can be very complicated at times, and it's difficult in some circumstances to find a copyright owner resulting in an orphaned work. Cornell has an excellent chart that details many other circumstances where things fall under the public domain:

What are statutory exemptions for copyright?,"## Statutory Exemptions
##### Library Copying (Section 108)
Most academic and public libraries can benefit from this provision that permits libraries to make copies of materials for preservation and security, to give copies to users for their private study or research, and to send copies through interlibrary loan. Like most of the statutes, it applies only to certain types of works, and only under certain circumstances.

##### First Sale (Section 109(a))
This important exception limits the distribution rights of the copyright holder by providing that once the owner authorizes the release of lawfully made copies of a work, those copies may in turn be passed along to others by sale, rental, loan, gift, or other transfer. This important exception allows libraries to lend materials and stores to sell books. The Supreme Court addressed this exception in the [Kirtsaeng](http://copyright.columbia.edu/copyright/2013/03/20/the-kirtsaeng-decision-copyright-logic-and-libraries/) decision, holding that the â€˜first saleâ€™ doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad.

##### Public Displays (Section 109(c))
One of the rights of copyright owners is the right to make public displays, but this statute allows the owner of a lawfully made copy of a work to display it to the public at the place where the work is located. The art museum that owns a painting may hang it on the wall; a bookstore can place books on display in front windows; and the library may put materials in the display cases for all to see.

##### Displays and Performances in Face-to-Face Teaching (Section 110(1))
Under this exception, educators may make performances and displays of all types of works in a classroom or similar place at most educational institutions. It allows instructors and students to recite poetry, read plays, show videos, play music, project slides, and engage in many other performances and displays of protected works in the classroom setting. This statute is actually comparatively simple and broad, but keep in mind that it permits only displays and performances in the classroomâ€”not the making of copies or the posting of digital works on servers.

##### Computer Software (Section 117)
This exception allows the owner of a copy of a computer program to modify the program to work on his or her computer or computer platform, and to make a back-up copy of the software to use in the event of damage to or destruction of the original copy. Realistically, most commercial programs are sold for use on multiple platforms, or the rights of use may be governed by license agreements.

##### Architectural Works (Section 120)
Architectural designs are protected by copyright, but this exception makes clear that, once a building is constructed at a place visible to the public, anyone may make and use a picture of that building without infringing the copyright in the architectural design. We might infringe copyright when we reproduce blueprints or duplicate the Trump Tower, but we are not infringing when we snap a photograph and use it in a book or even on postcards.

##### Special Formats for Persons Who Are Blind or Have Other Disabilities (Section 121)
This exception permits certain organizations to make specific types of formats of published, non-dramatic literary works in order that they may be useful to persons who are blind or have other disabilities. For example, some educational institutions and libraries may be able to make large-print or Braille versions of some works in the collection.

What is Fair Use?,"## Fair Use Basics
One of the limitations on copyright is the Fair Use doctrine, which can be found in [section 107 of the copyright law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107). This broad and flexible doctrine provides instances for when using copyrighted material may be deemed fair. Each of the four factors must be weighed in determining if fair use applies:
- The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
- The nature of the copyrighted work
- The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
- The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.
Another important consideration is if your use may be transformative. In other words, is your use of the work substantially different from the original intention of the work?

Are there resources to help me determine Fair Use?,"## Fair Use Checklist Examples

What are the evaluation methods for digital scholarship?,"## Evaluation Methods
Peer evaluation is an important part of scholarly publication. But how should nontraditional scholarly output be evaluated? In this section, we'll provide brief suggestions for evaluating digital scholarship and a curated list of peer-reviewed journals that review and publish on digital scholarship or digital humanities projects.
- Scholarship: Is the project intellectually rigorous? Is the methodology sound? Are arguments properly developed?

- Technology: Is the technical design sound? Does it make use of appropriate digital tools, or create robust technologies for use in the field? Is the site interoperable? Does it use appropriate web standards?

- Audience: Does the project effectively engage academic and public audiences?

- Editorial quality: Are appropriate editorial standards, such as TEI, used? Is the site clear and free from grammatical or spelling issues? Is the site accessible? Is a metadata schema used consistently?

- Sustainability: Does the project address digital preservation?
Vol. 1, No. 4 of the Journal of Digital Humanities presents a number of comprehensive approaches for evaluating digital scholarship. This issue should be consulted to gain a better understanding of the complexities and considerations of evaluating digital scholarship.

How can I find openly available research works?,"## Finding Openly Available Works
Even if you don't have institutional access to certain research, you may be able to access an openly available version of the work. Here, we share tools to help you locate open access copies. You can use the search bar below provided by the [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org/) to search by URL, DOI, title, or citation. Sometimes, a quick title search in [Google](https://www.google.com/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) will direct you to OA research. There are also plug ins and repositories you can use to find freely available works.

## Browser Plug-Ins
The [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org/) searches thousands of sources in one click to locate openly available research. You can download a browser extension through [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-access-button/gknkbkaapnhpmkcgkmdekdffgcddoiel?utm_source=inline-install-disabled) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/openaccessbutton/) to locate research and, if unavailable, contact the author with one simple click for a copy of the work.
[Unpaywall ](https://unpaywall.org/)harvests open access content and makes it discoverable through a browser extension in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha) or [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unpaywall/). When the plug-in encounters a DOI, it'll automatically direct you to an OA version of the work if available.

## Open Access Repositories
There are many repositories that archive and make works openly available. As mentioned previously, articles in these repositories will often show up in a simple [Google](https://www.google.com/) or [Google Scholar ](https://scholar.google.com/)search. Explore open access repositories from:
- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
- [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)

Why is a consistent file naming strategy important?,"Developing and following a consistent file naming strategy can make data easier to find, particularly when large numbers of files exist. Although it's common to think that file names will be remembered in the future, unorganized files and folders can lead to frustration down the road.

Good file naming allows you to identify the contents of the file from the name. It may be useful to consider including some or all of the following information, as long as it is done consistently.
- File creator's name/initials
- Date of creation
- Version number
- Project or experiment name or acronym
- Location/spatial coordinates
- Type of data
- Conditions
- File version number
- Keep file names as short as possible while including necessary information.
- Do not use special characters such as #, <, >, $, +, %, *, etc. Different operating systems may interpret these as instructions to perform special tasks.
- Use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_), full stops (.), or spaces in file names.
- If you add dates, make sure you use consistent formatting.
- While underscores are invisible when links are underlined, hyphens can still be seen.
- For files that might be searched online, some search engines don't recognize underscores and others may downgrade page rankings if underscores are used.

What file formats should I use to ensure long-term accessibility?,"As anyone with data saved on a floppy disk probably realizes, technology changes constantly and, if not planned for, hardware and software obsolescence can render data inaccessible and unreadable. To ensure long-term accessibility of research data, researchers should consider using file formats that share these characteristics:
- Non-proprietary
- Open, documented standard
- Common usage by research community
- Standard representation ([ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com/),[Unicode](http://unicode.org/))
- Unencrypted
- Uncompressed

Data saved in proprietary formats are vulnerable to obsolescence. Here are examples of open file formats you can use to increase the likelihood that research data will be accessible in the future. A number of applications have been developed to open these types of files:
- instead of a Microsoft Word extension (.doc, .docx)
- instead of a Microsoft Excel extension (.xls, .xlsx)
- TIFF or[JPEG2000](https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/)instead of .gif or .jpg

How can I determine if a journal is predatory?,"## Determining if a Journal is Predatory
- Closely examine the editor and staff of the journal. Is a single editor responsible for a large number of journals across a publisher? Is there a lack of information or diversity on the editorial or review board?
- Does the publisher fail to list transparent policies and fees? Did the publisher's operations begin with a large fleet of quickly created journals?
- Is the contact information for the publisher, editors, or review board difficult to find or not present?
- Is the journal title misleading, or does it list a false impact factor or other quality-determining metrics?
- Does the journal send spam requests for manuscripts or peer reviews to scholars not qualified to write on or review the subject in question?
- Are previously published articles low quality or re-published without proper permissions from other journals?

How can I make my class affordable?,"## Making Your Class Affordable
Many faculty members across USC have converted traditional courses to zero cost courses. How can you do the same? There's no one answer for everyone, but you can use a mix of Open Educational Resources, library-licensed resources, and items freely available or in the public domain on the web. Don't get discouraged if you do not immediately see an open textbook that fits your needs. A librarian can help you locate alternate resources to make your class affordable.

## Using OER
Using Open Educational Resources (OER) is one way to make your class affordable. Most OER are funded by governments, foundation grants, or universities and are created, edited, and peer-reviewed by academics, ensuring that their quality is comparable to traditional textbooks. While many OER are created for lower level, high-enrollment courses, more are being developed for higher-level specialized courses. To locate OER to use in your classes, visit [http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks](http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks).

## Using Library-Licensed Resources
While library-licensed resources are not OER and may come with copyright and licensing restrictions, using materials available through your library can save your students money. The library offers e-books, databases, and other digital resources that can be accessed through Blackboard or your syllabus.

How do the SCoer Awards work?,"To participate in the program, Track One honorees attend a workshop hosted by University Libraries to help them identify or create OER materials for their courses. They commit to switching from the use of a traditional textbook to an OER or library-based resource in one of their classes and are recognized with a certificate and a $1,000 award.

Track Two honorees are recognized for their existing use of OER materials and agree to serve as affordable learning advocates and to create resources for other instructors interested in transitioning to the use of affordable learning materials.

Award recipients are selected by USC Student Government representatives and University Libraries staff.

What do the winners of the SCoer Awards say about the program?,"Instructor, Department of English: I know from personal experience how book costs can prevent equal learning. I borrowed all my undergraduate books from my university library! I also have a freshman student in the family starting at USC this fall so will experience price shock and textbook buying first-hand.

Associate Professor, Department of Teacher Education: As an educator, I am always reflecting on how I can make my courses more engaging for students as I develop a challenging curriculum.  I am drawn to the opportunity to learn new things. Participating in this program will allow me to develop new skills as well as improve existing ones.  Creating a variety of resources to help my students will ensure that they can make connections to the content and engage in the learning.

Professor of Philosophy and Director of Undergraduate Studies, Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies: I have been using no-cost materials that the library licenses and owns since 2013. It has made teaching so much easier I can't believe everyone doesn't do itâ€¦. Using this library service has often felt like a secret; I don't know anyone else who uses it. I think it's important that more people realize that it's available and understand how using it can make teaching easier and more accessible.

Professor of History and Women's and Gender Studies: I have transitioned to supplying my students with all of the resources necessary for these courses using library databases such as Project Muse, JStor and others. I also utilize online newspaper collections so that students can do primary research for their projects. I provide ebooks when necessary and have relied on texts and open access materials that do not require to make any purchasesâ€¦.Part of the reason that students enjoy the course is because they can take it from any location and have the documents, videos, and assignments readily availableâ€¦.I am happy to share the resources I use with others, as I find that students have tremendous success in these courses. They also become more familiar with the library and all of the wonderful collections that are available to them.

The winners are , Department of Computer Science and Engineering, , Department of Psychology, ,Biological Sciences and ,College of Nursing."
What factors did the selection committee consider?,"The selection committee looks closely at three determining factors: applicants who showed a strong desire to learn the process of finding and using online educational resources, the potential for long-term financial savings for students, and the availability of OER materials on the subject taught, says , Scholarly Communication Librarian."
What do the winners plan to achieve with their awards?,"Meet this yearâ€™s winners:
I wrote a free textbook for upper-level robotics courses, but do not have experience identifying, selecting, and utilizing OER created by others, especially for lower-level courses like my UNIX/Linux Fundamentals course. The subject of this course is one that lends itself well to OER, compared to other aspects of computer science, because there is a long history and plenty of free materials. Students have told me that the current traditional textbooks are not helpful, so I suspect that an OER format may both improve learning outcomes and reduce the costs for students.
After years of teaching at UofSC, I can clearly identify the potential benefits of using affordable and accessible resources into my own classes. It seems to me that participating in this award program may greatly help me with this transition.
As a first-generation college student myself, I remember the struggle of having to decide between meals or textbooks. I remember the high cost of education being compounded by high textbook costs that seemed to provide just another barrier against an equitable educational experience. Now, as a faculty member at UofSC, I am focused on creating an equitable, anti-racist class for our students, and one of the direct ways I can take action is by offering a zero-cost course, in terms of needed materials. The pandemic has also brought to light the inequities in our community and in higher education. Equity is a concept that means a lot to me, and the more barriers I can help dismantle for the continued and augmented success of our students, the better, and this program will allow me the resources needed to do just that.
I am participating in this award program in order to enhance the overall course delivery modalities, engage students in meaningful learning, and cultivate a desire for students to embrace lifelong learning. I believe using innovative and intriguing strategies will better equip my students for success after college and allow them the opportunity to recognize that there are many ways to continue to grow and learn."

Meet this yearâ€™s winners:
### Gerald Brasington
I am a first-generation college and first-generation medical school graduate. Purchasing extremely expensive books caused financial hardship for me and my parents. I have dedicated my career to making materials low-cost or free so today's students will not face the same hardships as I did. Education is a gift, and I want to give that gift to my students without the fear or worry about affording the necessary materials.
### Amanda Fairchild
I am strongly invested in reducing course material costs. In my own studies, I always appreciated when professors offered a course pack or other material in lieu of a textbook. I would like to be able to provide a similar opportunity for my own students.
My colleague, Dr. Dexin Shi, and I both teach PSYC 227 and use the same textbook intentionally. We actively collaborate to coordinate course content to positively impact our students and improve our materials. I seek to collaborate with Dexin with this new open resource experience, so we can continue to optimize and streamline our course while reducing the costs students incur.
### Dexin Shi
As a college professor, I understand that textbooks can be expensive for students. Actually, price is one important factor for me when selecting textbooks for my classes. For example, I teach introduction to Statistics to psychology majors, and many textbooks cost over $100, and some even over $200. The cost of textbooks can be a burden for many students, given the number of classes they take. I am glad to learn about this award opportunity to develop a zero-cost course. I believe that free access to course materials could enhance the learning opportunities and outcome for my students.
### Ashley Williard
Especially during the COVID-19 crisis, it is crucial to democratize courses by making content affordable and accessible. Language textbooks are expensive, and it can be challenging to get French books shipped from abroad. Students already face enormous pressure from high tuition and an uncertain economy. By taking the expense of course materials out of the picture, all students can instead focus on content from day one of the semester, regardless of their financial situation. Providing equal access ensures a more fair, diverse and rich learning environment."

What are the goals and motivations of this year's SCoer Grant recipients?,"### Meredith DeBoom
I am a first-generation college graduate ... When I began my career as an Assistant Professor at USC in Fall 2018, I made a commitment to myself that improving the inclusivity of higher education would be a priority in my career. Rather than walking away with an expensive textbook, I would much rather my students leave with a clear understanding of how they can apply geographic tools and theories in their careers.
### Austin Downey
I want to use this program to help me to develop Open Educational Resources (OER) (textbook, code, and YouTube Videos) and a no-cost Mechanical Vibrations (EMCH 330) course that will be free of any copyright issues or software costs, allowing it to be freely shared.
### Jennifer Pournelle
As a primary instructor for a Carolina Core science course open to all non-science majors, I have the privilege of working with a huge share of students unfamiliar with, and often terrified by, science terms and practices they view as mystifying and inapplicable.
### Timothy Shaw
I have gotten permission to teach from the OpenStax text on a trial basis this fall and develop a slide set for later adoption in more sections based on the OER commons resources."

What criteria should I use to evaluate an OER?,"As the subject expert, you are the person most qualified to judge the quality of an OER. However, there are several criteria that may be helpful in evaluating OER.
Comprehensiveness
The text covers all areas and ideas of the subject appropriately and provides an effective index and/or glossary.
Content Accuracy
Content is accurate, error-free and unbiased.
Relevance/Longevity
Content is up-to-date, but not in a way that will quickly make the text obsolete within a short period of time. The text is written and/or arranged in such a way that necessary updates will be relatively easy and straightforward to implement.
Clarity
The text is written in lucid, accessible prose, and provides adequate context for any jargon/technical terminology used.
Consistency
The text is internally consistent in terms of terminology and framework.
Modularity
The text is easily and readily divisible into smaller reading sections that can be assigned at different points within the course (i.e., enormous blocks of text without subheadings should be avoided). The text should not be overly self-referential, and should be easily reorganized and realigned with various subunits of a course without presenting much disruption to the reader.
Organization/Structure/Flow
The topics in the text are presented in a logical, clear fashion.
Interface
The text is free of significant interface issues, including navigation problems, distortion of images/charts, and any other display features that may distract or confuse the reader.
Grammatical Errors
The text contains no grammatical errors.
Cultural Relevance
The text is not culturally insensitive or offensive in any way. It should make use of examples that are inclusive of a variety of races, ethnicities, and backgrounds.

How can students be involved in the creation of knowledge?,"There are many ways to involve students in the creation of knowledge. Some professors allow students to perform research and then [correct or contribute to a Wikipedia page](https://wikiedu.org/changing/students/). Others ask students to [create blogs or websites ](https://thechcexplored.wordpress.com/blog/)detailing their learning and experiences. Some simply ask students to learn about a topic and then create problems for other students to solve. There are professors who allow students to [annotate and discuss readings ](https://web.hypothes.is/education/)with each other and even those outside of the class visibly on the web. Other instructors facilitate open chats with students, authors, and experts through Twitter. Some students even produce [open, online textbooks](https://openeal.pressbooks.com/) that can be used by the larger education community.
