1. Can you explain the basics of machine learning?,"## What is Machine Learning? A machine is said to be if its performance or efficiency for a given task improves with the experience (past data). Machine Learning uses advanced algorithms to analyze and learn relationships between the data to make intelligent decisions on what it has learned. The algorithms use a large amount of data to find the relationship. This relationship is called a which is used to make useful predictions or generate content from the data. For example, we need physics-based mathematical equations of Earth's atmosphere to predict rainfall using traditional methods. Solving these complex equations requires massive computing resources and time, making the prediction task difficult. With the ML approach, we could provide enormous data to an ML model until the ML model eventually  the mathematical relationship between weather factors producing varying quantities of rain. If we give this model the current weather data, it would predict the amount of rain in the future.",Unmarked

5. Can you describe the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?,"## What are the different types of Machine Learning? There are 4 major types of ML problems: - Used for tasks where the target variable has defined labels or values.The target variable has 2 labels (binary class classification) or more (multiclass classification). For example:Whether USA will win or lose a match (binary).Gmail classifying email in classes like social, promotion, updates, or spam (multiclass).The output is numeric and has a continuous value and the task is to predict a value as closer to the actual output value. For example predict stock price of a stock. - Used for tasks where the target variable or output has no defined labels and hidden patterns in the data are discovered without human intervention.Discovering the inherent groupings in the data such as grouping customers by their purchasing behavior.Discover rules that describe large portions of the data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y - This is a hybrid technique between supervised and unsupervised learning, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. - Learning happens by taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path to take in a specific situation. If there is no training data, it is bound to learn from its experience. Reward is defined by the experts. Figure (2) gives the example of  supervised and unsupervised Learning.",Unmarked
