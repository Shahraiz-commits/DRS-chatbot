Machine Learning usesadvanced algorithms to analyze and learn relationships between the data to make intelligent decisions on what it has learned. The algorithms use a large amount of data to find the relationship. This relationship is called a model which is used to make useful predictions or generate content fromthe data.For example, we need physics-based mathematical equations of Earth's atmosphere topredict rainfall using traditional methods. Solving these complex equations requires massive computing resources and time, making the prediction task difficult. With the ML approach, wecould provideenormous data to an ML model until the ML model eventuallylearnedthe mathematical relationship between weather factors producing varying quantities of rain. If we give thismodel the current weather data, it would predict the amount of rain in the future.Figure 1 shows the difference between hardcoding the instructions to carry out a specific task versus using ML. Figure 1: Achieving a task with and without ML 1How generic AI differs from ML? AI system: Recommend songs to EVERYONE based on number of copies sold, top 10 in Billboard list, Grammy award winners, etc.ML system: Recommend songs to each INDIVIDUAL based on previous songs played, other people with similar playlist, choice of singer, genre, etc.When using Machine Learning, Neural Networks, or Deep Learning, it is important to know the meaning of the following terms:Task: Refers to a specific problem or objective that the algorithm is designed to solve.Algorithm: Set of rules that a machine follows to achieve a particular goal or the steps needed to get from the inputs to the output.Features attributes or variables: Observedmeasured properties or characteristics of the data that are used as input to create a model.Target: Variable whose value ispredicted or modeled by the features; used in supervised learning.Label: It is the categoryor classof the target variable. If only 2 labels such as 0 or 1, yesno, hotwarmcold.Training set: Subset of data on which the model is initially trained.Validation set: Subset of data distinct from training that is used by the model to predict output and validate the model.Test set: Subset of data different from training and validation on which model is tested.What are the different types of Machine Learning?There are 4 major types of ML problems:Supervised learning: Used for tasks where the target variable has defined labels or values.Classification: The target variable has 2 labels binary class classification or more multiclass classification. For example:Whether USA will win or lose a match binary.Gmail classifying email in classes like social, promotion, updates, or spam multiclass.Regression: The outputis numeric and has a continuous value and the task is to predict a value as closer to the actual output value. For example predict stock price of a stock.Unsupervised learning: Used for tasks where the target variable or output has no defined labels and hidden patterns in the data are discovered without human intervention.Clustering: Discovering the inherent groupings in the data such as grouping customers by their purchasing behavior.Association: Discover rules that describe large portions of the data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy YSemi-supervised learning: This is a hybrid technique between supervised and unsupervised learning, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data.Reinforcement learning:Learning happens by taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path to take in a specific situation. If there is no training data, it is bound to learn from its experience. Reward is defined by the experts.Figure 2 gives the example of supervised and unsupervised Learning. In figure 2, the classification task is to predict if the user has purchased or not 1 or 0. The regression task is to predict the wind speed.

There are many different styles to choose from when writing a paper, but many fields of study prefer a particular one. If you are unsure which style to use, check with your instructor.Citations and Citation StylesA citation is a reference to a source you used to support your research. Citations give credit to the original authors and can be used to locate particular sources and avoid plagiarism.A citation style dictates the information necessary for a citation and how the information is ordered, as well as punctuation and other formatting.Choosing a Citation StyleThis guide includes information on commonly used citation styles used in the sciences:American Chemical Society ACSDisciplines: Chemistry, BiochemistryAmerican Society of CivilEngineers ASCEDiscipliness: CivilEngineeringCouncil of Science Editors CSEDisciplines: Biological sciencesGeological Society of AmericaGSADisciplines: GeologyInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEEDisciplines: Engineering, Computer ScienceAvoiding PlagarismPlagiarism is the act of taking someone else's words or ideasand using them as your own. Often, students will plagiarize unintentionally. To avoid plagiarizing:Make sure you get all the citation information you need when you originally find the source.Learn how to paraphrase properly.ParaphrasingIf you gathered the information or ideas from another source, even if you used your own words, you must cite that source.Tips for paraphrasing sources:Try to understand the passage as a whole, rather than pausing to write down specific ideas or phrases.Be selective in what you paraphrase. Only summarize the material that is most valuable to your paper.Think of what your own words would be if you were describing the passage.Look away from the source then write. Read the passage several times until you feel that you understand it and can restate it in your own words. Then, look away from the original text and rewrite it in your own words.Take notes in your own words. Set the notes aside and then paraphrase from the notes later.

The checklist has developed into Evaluate Web Pages Widener University accessed March 30, 2006.Domain Types and What They MeanWhen browsing websites on the internet, pay attention to the domain type at the end of a companywebsite link - this information can give you a good sense of what to expect from the website or what their biases might beAdvocacy .orgPurpose:influence public opinion, sell ideasBusinessmarketing .comPurpose: promote or sell productsNews .comPurpose: provide extremely current informationInformational .edu or .govPurpose: present factual informationCriteria 1: AuthorityIs it clear who organization, institution, or person is responsible for the contents?Is there a link to a page describing the goals of the organization, the nature of the company, or purpose of the sponsor?Is there a way of verifying the legitimacy of the sponsor? That is, is there a phone number or postal address to contact for more information? An email address is not always enoughIs there a statement that the content of the page has the official approval of the sponsor?Is it clear whether this is a page from the main sponsor?Is there a statement giving the sponsor's name as copyright holder?Criteria 2: AccuracyAre the sources for any factual information clearly listed so they can be verified in another source? If not, the page may still be useful to you as an example of the ideas of the organization, but it is not useful as a source of factual informationIs the information free of grammatical, spelling, and typographical errors? These kinds of errors not only indicate a lack of quality control, but can actually produce inaccuracies in informationCriteria 3: ObjectivityAre the writer's sponsor's biases clearly stated?If there is any advertising on the page, is it clearly differentiated from the informational content?Criteria 4: CurrencyAre there dates on the page to indicate:When the page was written?When the page was first placed on the Web?When the page was last revised?Are there any other indications that the material is kept current?Criteria 5: CoverageIs there an indication that the page has been completed, and is not still under construction?Is it clear what topics the page intends to address?Does the page succeed in addressing these topics, or has something significant been left out?Is the point of view of the sponsor presented in a clear manner with its arguments well supported?Media BiasInteractive Media Bias ChartCurious how politics can affect the news?

There are three documentation systems used in CSE, so be sure to ask your instructor which system you are supposed to be citing for your paper.Citation-Sequence SystemIn the citation-sequence system, in-text references are cited with sequentialsuperscriptnumbers, such asthis1. If you are citing more than one reference within a sentence, you can use a superscript sequence of numbers, likethis2,3. In the references, list the citations in the numerical order that they appearin your paper.Citation-Name SystemAs in the citation-sequence system, superscript numbers are inserted at the point of reference. However, when you're organizing your reference list, you will first alphabetizeall the citations by authors' last names, then number them in your paper by the order they appearin the list of references.Name-Year SystemIn the name-year system, citations are inserted in your paper using the in-text style, which includes the author's name and year of publication within parentheses, such as Jefferson 2009. In the list of references, alphabetize all the citations by the authors' last names.CSE FormatReference lists areorganized based on the documentation system you are using.Citation-Sequence system: List the citation in the numerical order that it appears in your paper.Citation-Name system: Alphabetizeall the citations by authors' last names, then number them in your paper by the order they appear in the list of references.Name-Year system: Alphabetize all the citations by the authors' last names.Authors' last names are listed first, then the first and middle initial. No commas are used in between the last name and first initial. Additionally, no periods are used in betweeninitials.Use all authors' names if a work has up to ten authors listed. If more than ten authors are listed, list the first ten names, followed by a comma and et al.Only the first word and proper names in a book or article title are capitalized.Journal titles that consist of more than one word are abbreviated. All the words in abbreviated journal titles are capitalized.

Previous: Citation-NameNext: GSA Style ", "Citation StylesACS StyleASCE StyleCSE StyleCitation-Sequence Citation-Name Name-Year GSA StyleGSA StyleIn-Text CitationsReferences CitedCreating Figures and Tables IEEE Style GSA StyleGSA Style is the citation standard created by the Geological Society of Americaand is commonly used in the field of geology.A GSA citation consists of two parts:In-text citations: Every time you present information that you have obtained from another source, you must create an in-text citation for it. GSA Style does not use footnotes. Avoid using direct quotes and instead summarize in your own words the ideas or facts that come from a source. Summaries need to include in-text citations.References Cited: At the end of your literature review, you should have a reference list that will include all the sources that were cited in your paper.The content of citations will vary depending on the source, but the following rules apply to all citations:List references alphabetically by author's surname.List authors by full last name and initials for first and if applicable middle names.If a source's DOIdigital object identifier is available, you should include it at the end of the citation. This is only applicable to online sources, not print sources.The first line of each citation should be aligned with the left margin. The second and subsequent lines of each citation should be indented by 0.5 inches to create a hanging indent.GSA Reference Guidelines and ExamplesIn-Text CitationsWhen you present information that comes from another source, you should create an in-text citation that includes both the author's last name and the four digit year of publication. You can do this in one of two ways:Mention the author's last name in the sentence where you are presenting their findings, followed by the year in parentheses.Example: Smith 2011 found evidence that suggests that the RamapoFault has the potential to produce a major earthquake.At the end of the sentence, include both the author's last name and year of publication, separated by a comma.Example: Evidence suggests that the Ramapo Fault has the potential to produce a major earthquake Smith, 2011.Two authors: Include the last names of both authors either in the sentence or in parentheses.Examples:Brown and Matthews 2015suggest that the Ramapo Fault will cause a major earthquake.It has been suggested that the Ramapo Fault will cause a major earthquake Brown and Matthews, 2015.Three to five authors: Include the last name of each author the first time the source is cited in your paper. For each in-text citation of the source after that, list only the first author followed byet al.Examples:First citation of source: It has been suggested that the Ramapo Fault will cause a major earthquake Brown, Matthews, and Smith, 2015.Later citations of same source: It has been suggested that theRamapoFault will cause a major earthquake Brown et al., 2015.Six authors or more: For every in-text citation, list the last name of the author followed by et al.Example:It has been suggested that theRamapoFault will cause a major earthquake Barnes et al., 2013.References CitedAbstractsAuthors, Year of publication, Title, Source, volume if applicable, Pages.Example:Sears, J.W., 2012, Making Nuna and breaking Rodinia: Implications of Siberia-Laurentia connections for supercontinent cycles:Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 44, no. 7, p. 378.Articles articles in academic journals, newspapers, magazinesAuthors, Year of Publication, Title: Subtitle if applicable: Publication, Volume number, Page numbers, doi if applicable.Example:Coogan, L.A., and Hinton, R.W., 2006, Do the trace element compositions of detrital zircons require Hadean continental crust?:Geology, v. 34, p.633636, doi:10.1130G22737.1.Books books, pamphlets, and multi-volumepublications such as encyclopediasAuthors, Year of Publication, Title: Place of publication, Publisher, Number of pages.Example:Allmendinger, R.W., Cardozo, N., and Fisher, D., 2011, Structural Geology Algorithms: Vectors and Tensors in Structural Geology:New York, Cambridge University Press, 304 p.Chapters in a Book or Papers in a Multi-authorVolumeAuthors, Year of Publication, Title of chapter,inAuthorseditors of full volume, Title, Place of publication if available, Publisher if available, Volume if available, Pages.Example:Sawyer, D.S., Buffler, R.T., and Pilger, R.H., 1991, The crust under the Gulf of Mexico basin, in Salvador, A., ed.,The Gulf of Mexico Basin: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America, Geology of North America, v.
