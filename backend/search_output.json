Data can be analyzed and interpreted using statistical procedures to answer why or how. Data is used to create new information and knowledge.\nRaw data is the direct result of research that was conducted as part of a study or survey. It is a primary source. It usually comes in the form of a digital data set that can be analyzed using software such as Excel, , , and so on. This is what a data set looks like:\n\n \n#### Statistics\n- Statistical tables, charts, and graphs\n\n- Reported numbers and percentages in an article\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a quick number, you want a statistic.

When datasets are openly available, they can be easily accessed and used to create a fuller picture of a given area of inquiry, or analyzed by data mining software that can uncover connections not apparent to those who produce the original data.\n\n- . Researchers estimate that $3.2 trillion in economic output could be added to global GDP through Open Data across all sectors, with scientific and scholarly data playing an important role. [1]\n\n- . There are a huge number of ways to use or analyze any given dataset. What seems like noise to one person could be an important discovery to someone else with a different perspective or analytical technique.\n\n- . When the data that underlies findings is accessible, researchers can check each other's work and ensure that conclusions are built upon a firm foundation.\n\n- From research funders like the US government to publishers, institutions involved in the research process are beginning to require that, at the very least, the data that underlies publications be made openly accessible.\n\n[1] [https://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/insights/ON%20Report_061114_FNL.pdf](https://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/insights/ON%20Report_061114_FNL.pdf)\n[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Using visual features of encoded data such as position, size, shape, hue and saturation, motion, etc., data visualization applies tools and techniques to communicate the raw data in visual form.  \nCommon examples include charts, graphs, timelines, maps, and even tables.\n## Why Visualize Data?\nRaw data and statistics can often appear confusing. Many research data sets are going to be overwhelming in size. Data visualization applies what we know about human perception to optimize cognition, making it easier to understand, interpret, and analyze patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. \nUse of effective data visualization if often focused on one of two primary purposes:\n - sometimes referred to as sense-making or data analysis. Using visualization techniques to examine and discover trends, associations, outliers, etc., that may not be obvious when viewing the raw data.\n - also referred to as storytelling or communication. Creating visualizations that make understanding what the data is saying clearer and more obvious. \nSuccessful data visualization relies on selecting the appropriate tool, technique, and visual expression that most effectively presents the story the data is telling. Data visualization should be considered a means to an end, not an end in itself.\n## The Data Science Lifecycle\nData visualization is one component of a much broader data analytics life cycle. While there is some variation in defining the full data analytics life cycle, the graphic below presents a general structure encompassing the basic components.\n## Terminology\nWhen discussing data visualization, various related terms may be used somewhat loosely. The following is a very brief glossary of commonly used data terminology:\n- A process of building, cleaning, and structuring datasets for the purpose of analysis and extraction of meaning.\n- Analysis of data to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights.\n- techniques using geographic, topological,  or geometric properties to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights\n- ...refers to a variety of processes designed to transform raw data into more readily used formats.\n- [Data Wrangling: What It Is & Why It's Important](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\n- Information Visualization...visual metaphors for non-inherently spatial data ...\n\n- Scientific Visualization...the visual display of spatial data associated with scientific processes.\n- [Information and Scientific Visualization: Separate but Equal or Happy Together at Last](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250428)\n \n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=1316892&p=10439116)", "\n## Business Statistics and Data Set Resources\nBelow are some examples of resources that you can use to find business resources. \n## Statistics\n#### International Statistics\n\n- [Fitch Connect](https://saml.fitchconnect.com/saml/login?orgId=6iU4UH3SLU2L51lDBPe9iT)\n- [Hoover's Online](https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=https://www.mergentonline.com/Hoovers)\n- [IMF Data Mapper](http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/index.php)\n- [OECD iLibrary Statistics](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/statistics)\n- [OSHA Statistics and Data](https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/)\n- [Passport](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/sc.edu?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.portal.euromonitor.com%2Fportal%2Fserver.pt)\n\n#### U.S. Statistics\n\n- [Bureau of Economic Analysis](http://www.bea.gov/)\n- [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://stats.bls.gov/)\n- [City Data.com](http://www.city-data.com/)\n- [Consumer Expenditure Survey](http://www.bls.gov/cex/home.htm)\n- [GeoFRED](http://geofred.stlouisfed.org/)Regional data series includes: residential population, unemployment rate, earnings by place of work, and much more.
