It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.   It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.  This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.  It can be called Distant Reading, but you should also do a close reading on a portion of the texts so that you are well informed on the content you are researching. \n## Terminology\nContent Mining is the overall concept of pulling together into one place a large corpus of text, data, or images from various sources and running scripts on them to answer a research question. \n- [Text Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining)is a research technique using computational analysis to uncover patterns in large text-based data sets. (Wikipedia)\n\n- [Data Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining)is to use machine-learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data (Wikipedia)\n\n- [Webscraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), web harvesting or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from web sites. The term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler.\n\n- [Machine learning ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)(ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. (Wikipedia)\n\n- Topic Modeling: A form of text mining to identify patterns or topics in a large corpus of text.[(Blei, 2012)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf)\n\n- [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)(NLP) is s process of programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language texts.\n## Getting Started\n- What is your?\n\n- Pull together aof support: librarians, computer programmers, statisticians are on campus and here to help.\n\n- These projects taketo pull together and perform.

In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text. PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.  Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.  TXT , TSV, or CSV are the best formats for working with data.\nIf your computer can no longer handle the size of the data set, contact DoIT [Research Computing ](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rc/index.php)about their high performance computing (HPC) options.\n\n- [DataFile Converter](https://www.withdata.com/data-file-converter/)\n- [How to convert PDFs to Text files](https://www.pdf2go.com/)\n- [Tesseract OCR software](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/)\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=1341033)", "\n## Create and Manage Open Access Journals\nThe University of South Carolina Libraries offers software and support for the creation and management of open access journals. The library uses [Digital Commons software to host journals](https://www.bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/managing-publishing-journals/). Benefits of using this software include support for all types of content, search engine optimization, access to detailed analytics, and flexible peer-review workflows.\nUSC affiliated faculty are eligible for free journal hosting and support. Before launching a new journal, you\u2019ll need to carefully consider the details of your journal, including people, policies, content, production, design, workflow, and sustainability. In most cases, you'll be asked to sign a memorandum of understanding with the University Libraries to delineate expectations and responsibilities.\n## Details\n- Is this title already in use? Check[WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/)and[Ulrichsweb](https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://www.ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com)to confirm that the title is available. Make sure that the title is clear and can be abbreviated.\n\n- The library will provide a consultation to help you create a landing page for the journal. You will need to provide a color scheme and a banner or cover photo. You should also consider if you will need to create issue covers and images within the journal. You may wish to consult other[journals published through Digital Commons](https://www.bepress.com/categories_jnl/all-journals/)as examples of what is possible.\n\n- What subject areas and topics will the journal cover?What is the purpose of the journal?Are there existing journals with similar content? If so, what will make this journal unique?Who is the intended audience of this journal?\n\n- What types of materials will be accepted? Only research articles, or will you allow reviews, opinion pieces, videos, etc.?How will you solicit quality content over an extended period of time?\n\n- How often will issues/articles be published? Will articles be published as received or bundled as issues?\n\n- Will you[assign DOIs](https://www.doi.org/)to content? Digital Commons does not automatically assign DOIs, but USC Libraries is a[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/)member and can work with you to incorporate a DOI assignment workflow. The Libraries will be responsible for the cost of registering current content. If you would like to assign DOIs to backfiles, you will be responsible for the cost.\n\n- Journal indexing will make your journal and its content more discoverable. All new journals are required to obtain an ISSN.Once you have an ISSN, register with[Ulrich's Periodical Directory](https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://www.ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com)by emailing[ulrichs@proquest.com](mailto:ulrichs@proquest.com). In the email, include the journal name, publisher name (University of South Carolina Libraries), and any other relevant details. Read the[FAQs](http://www.ulrichsweb.com/ulrichsweb/faqs.asp)for more details.If your journal meets the[criteria](https://doaj.org/publishers#applying), register it with the[Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/application/new).Check[Google Scholar ](https://scholar.google.com/)to see if your journal appears. If it does not,[register it](http://www.google.com/support/scholar/bin/request.py).There will be additional indexing opportunities dependent on your discipline. You will likely be familiar with the databases used heavily in your field. Each will have different policies and procedures that are typically available from their website.\n\n- What is your expected timeline? Plan on allowing one or two years of preparation time for the first journal issue to be released.When would you like to issue the first call for papers?What is your target date for the first issue?","## Managing Open Access Journals\n## People\n- Who will serve as journal manager, the person who is primarily responsible for this journal during the planning stages and after the journal has launched?You will likely need a managing editor to create and publish journal issues, monitor submissions, and assign peer-reviewers. You may  need section editors to manage specific articles. Additionally, you will need production staff who handle tasks such as copyediting, layout, and proofing. You'll also likely need an editorial board, authors, and reviewers.While there certainly can be overlap in these roles (for example, you may choose to ask your editorial board to act as reviewers or content shepherds) and you don't necessarily need to have names in place to start the journal creation process, keep in mind tht these roles will continue to be necessary throughout the life of the journal. You should have an idea of how you will recruit participants.We recommend that you establish documentation detailing responsibilities and terms for each of these roles.\n\n- How will you recruit and train new board members and staff? How often will turnover take place? Do you have an idea of how long you will retain primary responsibility for the journal and who will replace you if you can no longer act as the journal manager?\n## Policies\n- How will submitted manuscripts be considered for inclusion? How will manuscripts be checked for plagiarism and/or copyright violations?\n\n- What kind of review will each submission require? Describe the procedure in detail, including the peer review process and reviewer guidelines if applicable. Digital Commons includes[workflow procedures for peer review](https://www.bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/3150/), but you should have an idea of what type of peer review is appropriate for your journal.Who will be involved in the peer review process?\n\n- All journals will be available open access immediately upon publication if hosted through the University of South Carolina Libraries. The open access policy should be clearly stated on the journal's webpage and on author submission agreements.\n\n- Who will hold the copyright for submissions? Many open access journals release content under a Creative Commons license.[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)has a selection tool for picking an appropriate license.Develop preliminary public statements for copyright policies, including rights, usage, attribution, and exceptions. You may wish to consult other journals in your field or[published through Digital Commons](https://www.bepress.com/categories_jnl/all-journals/)as examples.In the event of a copyright infringement claim or other legal challenge, USC Libraries may require the journal to remove the offending content from the journal.\n## Attribution\nParts of this work are derived from [Creating a New OJS Journal: Decisions](http://libguides.bc.edu/ld.php?content_id=42736086) created by Boston College Libraries, which is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).\nThis page is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). \n \n\n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/new)", "\n## Plan your Project\nCreating digital scholarship can take years of research, planning, and coordination, which is why it's important to create a project plan and timeline as early as possible. While your plan may evolve and need to be updated over time, it's a good idea to use it as a guide to stay organized. Here are some factors to consider:\n- What is the primary purpose of your project? Think of a way to describe your project in two or three sentences. This abstract can be used to pitch to funders or to communicate with your intended audience and peers.\n\n- Who will the audience be for your project? In most cases, it's available on the web, it will be available to anyone, but who would be most interested in your site? Consider how others might use or reuse your content.\n\n- Digital scholarship projects often, but not always, involve collaboration amongst scholars, digital specialists, librarians, and others. Consider who could provide useful contributions to the project. Are there students or peers who might like to get involved? Institutional partners?\n\n- You may need access to tools with associated costs or specialists that charge for their expertise. Don't discount the time and labor involved with the creation of a digital scholarship project. Students or even part-time associates may be necessary to complete your project. There are many[grant funding opportunities ](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants)available for digital humanities and digital scholarship projects.\n\n- What content management system (CMS) or platform would be the most effective for hosting your project? Do you already know how to use the CMS, or do you need training or assistance? Are there any preliminary or ongoing costs associated with your CMS of choice? For more information on choosing a CMS and the options available to you, visit[Content Management Systems.](https://sc.libapps.com/libguides/admin_c.php?g=943207&p=6798782)\n\n- What types of digital tools will you need beyond the CMS? If you plan to incorporate visualizations, annotations, maps, timelines, databases, or other types of digital content, you will need to be able to select and use these tools. Learn more from[Digital Tools](https://guides.library.sc.edu/digitalscholarship/tools).\n\n- Where will you store your master files and data? Many CMS have limited storage space available. The Libraries may offer storage options for different uses. Your University affiliation may effect your storage options, so consider if you will continue to need to host the content over a short time period or many years.\n\n- Good metadata, or information describing the various aspects of your project, is essential for helping users locate and access your project. How will you describe the files, pages, and other content included on your website? Some platforms, like Omeka, make it easy to incorporate metadata throughout your project.\n\n- You'll need to consider both your copyrights and the copyrights of others as you develop your product. Just because you've published your materials on the web doesn't mean that they aren't copyrighted. Consider[assigning a Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)to your works to grant users specific permissions for using your works. You'll also want to carefully consider if and how you reuse the copyrighted works, including text, videos, images, etc., of others.[Learn more about copyright, permissions, and licensing](https://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright). If there are privacy concerns, make sure they are addressed before publishing content.\n\n- Your project isn't finished once it's available online. Your website will need to be maintained and updated regularly. If your hosting service relies on funds or institutional credentials, consider how you might maintain access after your initial funding expires or if you leave your institution. If you remove the website, consider archiving your site for your own or external purposes. Explore our[Web Archiving](https://sc.libapps.com/libguides/admin_c.php?g=943207&p=6798779)page for more information.\n\n- Consider how you will promote and share your project. You may want to share your project through relevant teaching and scholarship Listservs, a[scholarship](http://guides.library.sc.edu/openaccessresources/repositories)or[teaching](http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/createOER)repository, or through social media.\n\n[Visualizing Objects, Places, and Spaces: A Digital Project Handbook](https://handbook.pubpub.org/) is a great resource for those interested in creating a digital project.

It allows them the control over copies, derivative works, public display, public performance, and transmission of their works. Copyright law attempts to balance the need to establish incentive for content creators to profit from their work, and thus have incentive to continue to create, with the additional need for society to have some rights to these works such as the right to criticize, parody, and use for education.  Although we do, as educators, have specific exceptions granted to us through this law, we still have obligations to meet so that we ensure that the rights of those who created the content are protected.\n\nCopyright covers any original work put in a tangible medium. This includes digital works (webpages, graphics, email, etc.), photographs, and computer software. It does not cover works of expression that are not in a tangible form (i.e. ideas, names, titles, concepts, or improvised performances that aren't recorded) and works in the public domain.\n## Making Copyright Decisions\n  Is the work covered by copyright or could it be part of the [Public Domain](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/publicdomain)? \nIdeas, facts, processes, and concepts cannot be copyrighted.  Works must meet a minimal level of originality to be able to be copyrighted.  Many works are in the public domain, which means they are free to be used by all.  [Learn more about the public domain.](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3629780)\n      Is there an [Exception](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/exceptions) that allows me to use this work?\nTake a look at the [special exceptions](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3629781) written into the copyright law by congress to help support teaching and scholarship.

It's important to understand the differences in the types of repositories to determine which is most appropriate for sharing your work. While there is some overlap between repository types, the three main types are:\n\nInstitutional repositories (IRs) are repositories that are hosted and managed by educational institutions. They exist to preserve and share the scholarly output of an educational institution. [Scholar Commons](http://scholarcommons.sc.edu) is the institutional repository of the University of South Carolina. It can be accessed from [http://scholarcommons.sc.edu](http://scholarcommons.sc.edu). \n\nDisciplinary repositories, sometimes known as subject repositories, are digital archives for subject-specific scholarly output. Some scholars choose to share their works through disciplinary repositories to increase the visibility of their work among subject experts and possible collaborators. Some disciplinary repositories rely on author generated content, while use web crawlers to locate and download publicly available content for inclusion. To find a disciplinary repository to share your work, visit the [Disciplinary Repositories Wiki](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Disciplinary_repositories) for a comprehensive list organized by subject.\n\nMultidisciplinary repositories archive and make available works across multiple disciplines. \n## What Can I Share?\nIt can be tricky to know which version of your work you can share. It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works. But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which? Visit the [Which Version Can I Share? ](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/sharing)page for an overview of pre-prints, post-prints, publisher PDFs and for information on how to locate these records. Sharing the legally-allowed version of your research protects your works from being taken down.\n## Social Networking\nSocial networking sites for academics, such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate, are used by some researchers to share their scholarly works and monitor analytics across disciplines. These sites are often used as social media and outreach tools. Because these types of sites have been regularly accused by publishers of [massive copyright infringement](http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/), it's important that researchers pay close attention to the terms of service and privacy policies of these sites.\nThe University of California Office of Scholarly Communication provides a [great read on the differences between academic social networking sites and open access repositories](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2015/12/a-social-networking-site-is-not-an-open-access-repository/?utm_source=hootsuite). \n## Scholar Commons\n#### Scholar Commons\n## Sharing Data\nThe University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data. However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist. If you want or need to share your research data, please visit the [Sharing Data guide](http://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=592274&p=4095611) to locate an appropriate repository and find additional information.\n## Featured Repositories\n- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)\n- [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)\n- [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)\n- [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/)\n- [PeerJ Preprints](https://peerj.com/about/preprints/scope-and-instructions/)\n- [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)\n- [SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com/)\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](http://guides.library.sc.edu/openaccessresources/repositories)", "\n## Creating and Modifying OER\nYou may choose to create or modify your own Open Educational Resources if you do not find resources available that suit your needs.\n## Creating OER\nCreating an OER is similar to authoring any other document, except that you are assigning that content an open license which usually allows for its free use and re-purposing by others. \nThings to consider:\n- What license will you assign to your OER? Using a[Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)will provide you with the legal framework to share your OER.\n\n- How will you make your OER accessible to all students? We recommend the[Open Education Consortium's guide](http://www.oeconsortium.org/resources/toolkits/accessibility/)to addressing accessibility issues.\n\n- Where will you create and host your OER? There are sites available from which you can directly upload and share your materials, and there are educational repositories designed specifically to assist with the creation and hosting of OER. For more information on creating and hosting OER, visit the section titled[Sites for creating and hosting OER](http://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=410356&p=3732812#s-lg-box-wrapper-13612726).\n\n- How will you share your OER? Once you've created your OER, you may want to share it across many directories and repositories for maximum visibility. Consider submitting your work to[MERLOT](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm),[OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/), or the[Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/).\n## Modifying OER\nModifying an existing OER is a a simpler way of adopting content to suit your needs than creating a new OER. Before modifying an OER, check that the Creative Commons license does not contain a no derivatives clause. If it does, you do not have permission to modify the work. Search for formats that are conducive to modification, such as .docx and .rtf. Once you've downloaded and modified the OER, you can upload it to many of the sites listed in the [Sites for Creating and Hosting OER](http://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=410356&p=3732812#s-lg-box-wrapper-13612726) section. \n## Resources for Creating and Hosting OER\n- [Google Drive](http://docs.google.com)\n- [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)\n- [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/)\n- [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/)\n- [Open Author from OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/)\n- [Merlot Content Builder](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm)\n- [WikiEducator](https://wikieducator.org/Main_Page)\n## Attribution\nSections of this page have been modified from the [COERLL Module on Open Educational Resources](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1097558), licensed under a [CC BY 4.0 Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) License.\n  \n \n\n\n[Learn more here](http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/createOER)", "\n## Freely available corpora to mine and analyze\nHere are a few collections of text that are freely available for text mining and analysis.

One important aspect of copyright law throughout history is that ideas and facts cannot be copyrighted.  For example, you may write a book about capitalism. The words you use to express your idea may be copyrighted; however, you cannot own the idea of capitalism. Ideas belong to our culture.\nThere is a minimal standard of originality that must be met for works to be protected by copyright. For example, if you were to take a picture of the Mona Lisa, it is a replication of the original. You cannot copyright that picture because it adds nothing original. However, if you were to add to the photo by changing the colors or other artistic elements, you might be able to copyright that image. Lists that lack originality, such as the white pages of a phone book, typically cannot be copyrighted because they do not meet the standard of minimal original content.\nAlso, facts and processes cannot be copyrighted. For example, a recipe for cheesecake with a list of ingredients, and instructions on how to bake the cake is not copyrightable. However, if you were to include stories of the person who created the recipe, or suggestions for ways to serve it, then that content would be copyrightable. \n## What is the Public Domain?\nA work in the public domain is not protected by copyright. The public domain is important to us as a culture. Allowing people to create using other people's ideas and works helps us remain an innovative and progressive society. Many important works are in the public domain. Some include:\n- works published before 1927\n\n- works where copyright has expired\n\n- most federal documents\n\n- facts, titles, ideas, etc.\n\nWhat is actually in the public domain can be very complicated at times, and it's difficult in some circumstances to find a copyright owner resulting in an orphaned work. Cornell has an excellent chart that details many other circumstances where things fall under the public domain:\n\n- [Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm)\n## Additional Resources\n- [Copyright Genie](http://librarycopyright.net/resources/genie/index.php)\n- [Copyright Renewal Database](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals)\n- [Copyright Renewals List](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce/)\n- [Renewal Record Transcriptions](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=11800)\n- [The Copyright Slider](http://librarycopyright.net/resources/digitalslider/index.html)\n- [Search Copyright Records](http://www.copyright.gov/records/)\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/publicdomain)", "\n## Statutory Exemptions\n##### Library Copying (Section 108)\nMost academic and public libraries can benefit from this provision that permits libraries to make copies of materials for preservation and security, to give copies to users for their private study or research, and to send copies through interlibrary loan. Like most of the statutes, it applies only to certain types of works, and only under certain circumstances.\n##### First Sale (Section 109(a))\nThis important exception limits the distribution rights of the copyright holder by providing that once the owner authorizes the release of lawfully made copies of a work, those copies may in turn be passed along to others by sale, rental, loan, gift, or other transfer. This important exception allows libraries to lend materials and stores to sell books. The Supreme Court addressed this exception in the [Kirtsaeng](http://copyright.columbia.edu/copyright/2013/03/20/the-kirtsaeng-decision-copyright-logic-and-libraries/) decision, holding that the \u2018first sale\u2019 doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad.\n##### Public Displays (Section 109(c))\nOne of the rights of copyright owners is the right to make public displays, but this statute allows the owner of a lawfully made copy of a work to display it to the public at the place where the work is located. The art museum that owns a painting may hang it on the wall; a bookstore can place books on display in front windows; and the library may put materials in the display cases for all to see.\n##### Displays and Performances in Face-to-Face Teaching (Section 110(1))\nUnder this exception, educators may make performances and displays of all types of works in a classroom or similar place at most educational institutions. It allows instructors and students to recite poetry, read plays, show videos, play music, project slides, and engage in many other performances and displays of protected works in the classroom setting. This statute is actually comparatively simple and broad, but keep in mind that it permits only displays and performances in the classroom\u2014not the making of copies or the posting of digital works on servers.\n##### Computer Software (Section 117)\nThis exception allows the owner of a copy of a computer program to modify the program to work on his or her computer or computer platform, and to make a back-up copy of the software to use in the event of damage to or destruction of the original copy. Realistically, most commercial programs are sold for use on multiple platforms, or the rights of use may be governed by license agreements.\n##### Architectural Works (Section 120)\nArchitectural designs are protected by copyright, but this exception makes clear that, once a building is constructed at a place visible to the public, anyone may make and use a picture of that building without infringing the copyright in the architectural design. We might infringe copyright when we reproduce blueprints or duplicate the Trump Tower, but we are not infringing when we snap a photograph and use it in a book or even on postcards.\n##### Special Formats for Persons Who Are Blind or Have Other Disabilities (Section 121)\nThis exception permits certain organizations to make specific types of formats of published, non-dramatic literary works in order that they may be useful to persons who are blind or have other disabilities. For example, some educational institutions and libraries may be able to make large-print or Braille versions of some works in the collection.\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/exceptions)", "\n## Licensing\nIn some circumstances, a may be covered by a license that would allow you to use it in certain ways. \n## Creative Commons\n[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) is a nonprofit organization that enables the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools.

This broad and flexible doctrine provides instances for when using copyrighted material may be deemed fair. Each of the four factors must be weighed in determining if fair use applies:\n- The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes\n\n- The nature of the copyrighted work\n\n- The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole\n\n- The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.\n\nAnother important consideration is if your use may be transformative. In other words, is your use of the work substantially different from the original intention of the work?\n## Fair Use Checklist Examples\nThere are many Fair Use checklists developed that have been developed by U.S. universities. These may be useful in helping you determine whether your intended use of a work is fair. \n\n- [Cornell University Fair Use Checklist](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/ld.php?content_id=63936868)\n- [Columbia University Fair Use Checklist](http://copyright.columbia.edu/copyright/fair-use/fair-use-checklist/)\n- [Fair Use Evaluator Tool](http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/index.php)\n## Fair Use for Students\n- [Fair Use in a Day in the Life of a College Student](https://guides.library.sc.edu/ld.php?content_id=19742476)\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/fairuse)", "\n## You May Not Need Permission If....\n- your use is within[fair use](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3630697)or another copyright exception;\n\n- the work is[not protected](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3629780)by copyright at all; or\n\n- your use is within the terms of a license agreement, including a[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)license from the author; or\n\n- the library has already[purchased a license](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3630699)so you can link to the information.\n## Seeking Permission\nIf none of the circumstances above apply, you may still be able to use the work if you seek permission.\nSeeking copyright permission can be difficult but necessary work.

But how should nontraditional scholarly output be evaluated? In this section, we'll provide brief suggestions for evaluating digital scholarship and a curated list of peer-reviewed journals that review and publish on digital scholarship or digital humanities projects. \n- Scholarship: Is the project intellectually rigorous? Is the methodology sound? Are arguments properly developed?\n\n- Technology: Is the technical design sound? Does it make use of appropriate digital tools, or create robust technologies for use in the field? Is the site interoperable? Does it use appropriate web standards?\n\n- Audience: Does the project effectively engage academic and public audiences?\n\n- Editorial quality: Are appropriate editorial standards, such as TEI, used? Is the site clear and free from grammatical or spelling issues? Is the site accessible? Is a metadata schema used consistently?\n\n- Sustainability: Does the project address digital preservation?\n\nVol. 1, No. 4 of the Journal of Digital Humanities presents a number of comprehensive approaches for evaluating digital scholarship.

Although it's common to think that file names will be remembered in the future, unorganized files and folders can lead to frustration down the road.\nGood file naming allows you to identify the contents of the file from the name. It may be useful to consider including some or all of the following information, as long as it is done consistently.\n- File creator's name/initials\n\n- Date of creation\n\n- Version number\n\n- Project or experiment name or acronym\n\n- Location/spatial coordinates\n\n- Type of data\n\n- Conditions\n\n- File version number\n- Keep file names as short as possible while including necessary information.\n\n- Do not use special characters such as #, <, >, $, +, %, *, etc. Different operating systems may interpret these as instructions to perform special tasks.\n\n- Use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_), full stops (.), or spaces in file names.\n\n- If you add dates, make sure you use consistent formatting.\n- While underscores are invisible when links are underlined, hyphens can still be seen.\n\n- For files that might be searched online, some search engines don't recognize underscores and others may downgrade page rankings if underscores are used.\n\n \nAs anyone with data saved on a floppy disk probably realizes, technology changes constantly and, if not planned for, hardware and software obsolescence can render data inaccessible and unreadable.

Is a single editor responsible for a large number of journals across a publisher? Is there a lack of information or diversity on the editorial or review board?\n\n- Does the publisher fail to list transparent policies and fees? Did the publisher's operations begin with a large fleet of quickly created journals?\n\n- Is the contact information for the publisher, editors, or review board difficult to find or not present?\n\n- Is the journal title misleading, or does it list a false impact factor or other quality-determining metrics?\n\n- Does the journal send spam requests for manuscripts or peer reviews to scholars not qualified to write on or review the subject in question?\n\n- Are previously published articles low quality or re-published without proper permissions from other journals?\n## Industry Memberships\nMembership in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) or the [Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association](http://oaspa.org/) is a good indicator that a journal is not predatory.

Hardware failure, virus infection, hacking, and loss or theft of hardware are all common realities that can have a devastating effect on research if proper back-up hasn't taken place. See the [UK Data Archive's guidelines on Backing-up Data](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/store.aspx) for more information.\n\nBack-up and storage are related concepts, but are not the same thing. While storage refers to ways of preserving files for the short- or long-term, back-up refers to preserving copies of your files in different physical locations and using different media to protect against data loss.\n\nA good rule of thumb for backing up data is the 3-2-1 rule. It states that at least 3 total copies of data should exist, 2 of which are local but on different media (devices), and at least 1 copy should be stored offsite. The offsite storage is important in case of fires, floods, or theft.\nWhile information security is concerned with protection, privacy is concerned with the sensitivity of data, the justification for collecting data, and decisions about notification and sharing.

How can you do the same? There's no one answer for everyone, but you can use a mix of Open Educational Resources, library-licensed resources, and items freely available or in the public domain on the web. Don't get discouraged if you do not immediately see an open textbook that fits your needs. A librarian can help you locate alternate resources to make your class affordable. \n## Using OER\nUsing Open Educational Resources (OER) is one way to make your class affordable. Most OER are funded by governments, foundation grants, or universities and are created, edited, and peer-reviewed by academics, ensuring that their quality is comparable to traditional textbooks. While many OER are created for lower level, high-enrollment courses, more are being developed for higher-level specialized courses. To locate OER to use in your classes, visit [http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks](http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks). \n## Using Library-Licensed Resources\nWhile library-licensed resources are not OER and may come with copyright and licensing restrictions, using materials available through your library can save your students money. The library offers e-books, databases, and journals that can be easily linked to and freely accessed through Blackboard or your syllabus.\n## Course Materials Support\nThe library will scan library materials or find links to resources for you at no cost in Blackboard. We will also address copyright concerns connected to posting these materials. To provide this service, we need a list of the reading assignments as well as the dates of the assignments.\n\n- [Course Materials Support](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/find_services/faculty_services/course_materials/index.php)\n## SCoer Faculty Awards\n \nCheck the [SCoer website](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/find_services/faculty_services/course_materials/scoer/index.php) for information on upcoming SCoer Awards. \n\n- [2024 SCoer Winners](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/2024/scoer_winners_24.php)\n- [2023 SCoer Winners](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/2023/scoer_winners_23.php)\n- [2022 SCoer Winners](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/2022/scoer_2022.php)\n- [2021 SCoer Winners](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/2021/scoer_2021.php)\n- [2020 SCoer Winners](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/scoer2020.php)\n- [2019 SCoer Winners](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/scoer_2019.php)\n- [2018 SCoer Winners](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/2018/scoer_2018.php)\n## Statewide Initiatives\nLearn about [statewide initiatives](http://pascalsc.libguides.com/scale/faculty) to help you adopt affordable resources offered by the Partnership Among South Carolina Academic Libraries (PASCAL).

While they can save students hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year in\n textbook costs, they allow faculty to customize course materials to fit their teaching\n needs more than traditional textbooks typically can.\nGiven annually by University Libraries, the SCoer Awards recognize and support faculty\n who use open educational resources in their classrooms. To date, USC faculty who have\n worked with the Libraries to adopt affordable learning materials have saved students\n more than $3 million in textbook costs.\nTo participate in the program, Track One honorees attend a workshop hosted by University\n Libraries to help them identify or create OER materials for their courses. They commit\n to switching from the use of a traditional textbook to an OER or library-based resource\n in one of their classes and are recognized with a certificate and a $1,000 award.\n Track Two honorees are recognized for their existing use of OER materials and agree\n to serve as affordable learning advocates and to create resources for other instructors\n interested in transitioning to the use of affordable learning materials.\nAward recipients are selected by USC Student Government representatives and University\n Libraries staff.\nStudents are craving more affordable learning opportunities in higher education more\n and more every day, says Student Body president Patton Byars, who served on this\n year\u2019s selection committee. The 2024 SCoer Faculty Award winners embody USC\u2019s commitment\n to learning access and opportunity for all students and as Student Body President,\n I commend the winners for their hard work in creating accessible learning solutions\n on our campus.\nScholarly Communications Librarian and Assistant Head of Acquisitions Amie Freeman,\n the SCoer Award coordinator, adds Revising a course to use new course materials is\n an enormous undertaking. I am pleased that the Libraries has the opportunity to support\n and thank faculty who are committed to providing students with equitable access to\n learning materials.\n\n \nInstructor, Department of English\nI know from personal experience how book costs can prevent equal learning. I borrowed\n all my undergraduate books from my university library! I also have a freshman student\n in the family starting at USC this fall so will experience price shock and textbook\n buying first-hand.\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Teacher Education\nAs an educator, I am always reflecting on how I can make my courses more engaging\n for students as I develop a challenging curriculum.  I am drawn to the opportunity\n to learn new things. Participating in this program will allow me to develop new skills\n as well as improve existing ones.

Using\n this library service has often felt like a secret; I don't know anyone else who uses\n it. I think it's important that more people realize that it's available and understand\n how using it can make teaching easier and more accessible.\n\nProfessor of History and Women's and Gender Studies\nI have transitioned to supplying my students with all of the resources necessary\n for these courses using library databases such as Project Muse, JStor and others.\n I also utilize online newspaper collections so that students can do primary research\n for their projects.

They commit to switching from the use of a traditional textbook to an OER\n or library-based resource in one of their classes and are recognized with a certificate\n and a $500 award. \nAward recipients are selected by USC Student Government representatives and University\n Libraries staff. \nThe selection committee looks closely at three determining factors, says , Scholarly Communication Librarian. Those include a strong desire to learn the process\n of finding and using online educational resources, the potential for long-term financial\n savings for students, and the availability of OER materials on the subject taught.\n This year\u2019s winners have shown great enthusiasm for using OER in their courses, and\n we congratulate them. \nStudent body president Emmie Thompson says the award recipients\u2019 commitment to keeping\n costs down for their students is deeply appreciated: We are very thankful for these\n professors who are going beyond what is expected to ensure students have access to\n resources they need to succeed. Textbooks can be such a costly expense to students,\n so this program is huge help in easing that burden for students and promoting equity\n across campus. \nStudent Government Deputy Secretary of Academics Maddie Moore adds that the honorees\u2019\n commitment to supporting students can be very impactful: Thank you to the professors\n of this award for their dedication to allowing their students to succeed. This award\n shows the importance of low-cost resources and allowing students to flourish in the\n classroom. \n\n \n Our program is the home to the curriculum for the design and development of distance\n learning and online courses. Our courses should reflect the variety of current technologies\n and resources available to our students, as well as our students\u2019 students. We must\n model OER and open pedagogy for our students. I am also interested in providing a\n more diverse body of knowledge and content with authors who may be outside of mainstream\n academic publishing or using other venues to share their works. \n I have always kept cost in mind since I started to teach at USC. As a graduate student,\n I had to save money at the beginning of each semester to purchase textbooks. The average\n salary for teachers can make the cost of a $100 textbook burdensome for them. I look\n forward to learning more about how to create a personalized OER that fits the needs\n of my course with all sorts of open educational resources, and I anticipate that putting\n this OER resource to use will improve awareness of OER resources among the multiple\n instructors who are teaching the course. \n OER has been a central focus of my research endeavors, and I have conducted multiple\n research projects promoting the adoption of OER in K-12 and higher education. Participating\n in SCoer presents a valuable opportunity for me to translate my research findings\n into actionable teaching practices. I am deeply passionate about open education and\n firmly believe in its principles of openness, inclusiveness, and accessibility. Embracing\n the use of OER not only offers the potential to reduce students\u2019 educational expenses\n without compromising their learning outcomes but also allows me to tailor personalized\n instruction to cater to the unique needs of each student. \nI would like to reduce the cost to students; we don\u2019t use the entire book, and students\n who purchased the book for prior courses have sometimes not kept it and then have\n to buy it again. I\u2019m also interested in finding a wider variety of textbooks on entrepreneurship\n and on adjacent topics germane to the class. \n# Since 2015\n\nNow in its ninth year, the SCoer faculty awards encourage the use of [Open Educational Resources](https://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/OpenEducationalResources?_gl=1*1ox44gq*_ga*MTYxMDAyMTI4LjE2ODc1NDI3NDU.*_ga_ZGG9QXHNZF*MTY5MjcxOTI4OS44OC4xLjE2OTI3MTk4MDEuMC4wLjA.)

Participating in this program\n has already broadened my knowledge of the many resources we have through our libraries.\n\nAssociate Professor of History\n\nDepartment of History \nIn a big survey class of 250 students (500 annually), we can save substantial costs\n every year by switching from hard copy textbooks to OER. Most faculty (myself included)\n have already started this process, but I feel there's much more to learn about OER\n than I've given myself time to explore. I'd welcome the opportunity to learn from\n people who know more about it than me, and I can share that knowledge with my colleagues\n in the history department, many of whom teach large introductory survey classes.\n\nInstructor\n\nDepartment of Psychology\nI applied for the funds because in my very first semester teaching (spring 2022)\n face to face, I had two students from one class approach me after class and explain\n they were not able to purchase the textbook until their next paycheck, and only IF\n they accrued no other incidental expenses which would prohibit them from paying their\n rent in full for the month. I went back to my book publisher and shared these student\n conversations and my rep graciously offered me two access codes so they could access\n the text free of charge. I remembered as a student of many years, there were semesters\n wherein purchasing a text was delayed, shared or borrowed. When I saw the opportunity\n to apply for SCoer, I didn't think twice. This will allow me to rethink the structure\n of my course and make pedagogical adjustments. I'm excited to have the opportunity\n to offer a textbook-free course in the fall! \n\nAssociate Professor\n\nInstruction and Teacher Education\nOER is easy to access for students in different locations in the state and even overseas\n in an online course. I had students from other countries and areas, and it took time\n to get their textbooks delivered. Also, I want to provide a broader range of digital\n learning materials to students in this virtual environment. Traditional textbook learning\n does not suit the needs of diverse learners from different areas. My students are\n in-service or pre-service teachers. Teachers struggle with their educational expenses\n with low salaries and high tuition fees. The textbooks are very expensive for many\n students.

With textbook prices sometimes hundreds of dollars\n each, it puts a burden on students. Open Educational Resources make sure that class\n materials are available to all students. \n\nMeet this year\u2019s winners:\nI wrote a free textbook for upper-level robotics courses, but do not have experience\n identifying, selecting, and utilizing OER created by others, especially for lower-level\n courses like my UNIX/Linux Fundamentals course. The subject of this course is one\n that lends itself well to OER, compared to other aspects of computer science, because\n there is a long history and plenty of free materials. Students have told me that the\n current traditional textbooks are not helpful, so I suspect that an OER format may\n both improve learning outcomes and reduce the costs for students.\nAfter years of teaching at UofSC, I can clearly identify the potential benefits of\n using affordable and accessible resources into my own classes. It seems to me that\n participating in this award program may greatly help me with this transition.\nAs a first-generation college student myself, I remember the struggle of having to\n decide between meals or textbooks. I remember the high cost of education being compounded\n by high textbook costs that seemed to provide just another barrier against an equitable\n educational experience. Now, as a faculty member at UofSC, I am focused on creating\n an equitable, anti-racist class for our students, and one of the direct ways I can\n take action is by offering a zero-cost course, in terms of needed materials. The pandemic\n has also brought to light the inequities in our community and in higher education.\n Equity is a concept that means a lot to me, and the more barriers I can help dismantle\n for the continued and augmented success of our students, the better, and this program\n will allow me the resources needed to do just that.\nI am participating in this award program in order to enhance the overall course delivery\n modalities, engage students in meaningful learning, and cultivate a desire for students\n to embrace lifelong learning. I believe using innovative and intriguing strategies\n will better equip my students for success after college and allow them the opportunity\n to recognize that there are many ways to continue to grow and learn.\n# Since 2015\n\nNow in its seventh year, the SCoer faculty awards encourage the classroom use of [Open Educational Resources (OER)](https://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/OpenEducationalResources) \u2013 teaching, learning and research resources that are freely available to students.\n The awards  are sponsored by the University of South Carolina Libraries.\n# 2021 SCOER Award WINNER\nJason O'Kane\n# 2021 SCoer Award Winner\nAndy Schumpert\n# 2021 SCOER Award WINNER\nKimberly Taylor\n\n\n[Learn more here](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/2021/scoer_2021.php)", "\n- \n## Four faculty win SCoer awards for 2020\nCongratulations to the four recipients of this year\u2019s SCoer Faculty Awards.

These winners have shown great enthusiasm for using OER in their courses,\n and we congratulate them.\nMeet this year\u2019s winners:\n### Gerald Brasington\nI am a first-generation college and first-generation medical school graduate. Purchasing\n extremely expensive books caused financial hardship for me and my parents. I have\n dedicated my career to making materials low-cost or free so today's students will\n not face the same hardships as I did. Education is a gift, and I want to give that\n gift to my students without the fear or worry about affording the necessary materials.\n### Amanda Fairchild\nI am strongly invested in reducing course material costs. In my own studies, I always\n appreciated when professors offered a course pack or other material in lieu of a textbook.\n I would like to be able to provide a similar opportunity for my own students.\nMy colleague, Dr. Dexin Shi, and I both teach PSYC 227 and use the same textbook\n intentionally. We actively collaborate to coordinate course content to positively\n impact our students and improve our materials. I seek to collaborate with Dexin with\n this new open resource experience, so we can continue to optimize and streamline our\n course while reducing the costs students incur.\n### Dexin Shi\nAs a college professor, I understand that textbooks can be expensive for students.\n Actually, price is one important factor for me when selecting textbooks for my classes.\n For example, I teach introduction to Statistics to psychology majors, and many textbooks\n cost over $100, and some even over $200. The cost of textbooks can be a burden for\n many students, given the number of classes they take. I am glad to learn about this\n award opportunity to develop a zero-cost course. I believe that free access to course\n materials could enhance the learning opportunities and outcome for my students.\n### Ashley Williard\nEspecially during the COVID-19 crisis, it is crucial to democratize courses by making\n content affordable and accessible. Language textbooks are expensive, and it can be\n challenging to get French books shipped from abroad. Students already face enormous\n pressure from high tuition and an uncertain economy. By taking the expense of course\n materials out of the picture, all students can instead focus on content from day one\n of the semester, regardless of their financial situation.

These instructors\n will create or incorporate open educational resources and other free learning resources\n into their classroom, exploring innovative new pedagogical practices and, in the process,\n save their students significant sums of money. The winners are , School of the Earth, Ocean and Environment; , Department of Mechanical Engineering; , Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry; and , Department of Geography.\nNow in its fifth year, the SCoer Faculty Grant encourages the classroom use of Open\n Educational Resources (OER) \u2013 teaching, learning and research resources that are freely\n available to students. The grant is sponsored by the University of South Carolina\n Libraries.\nTo participate in the program, the winning faculty members each attended a one-hour\n workshop hosted by the University Libraries to help them identify or create OER materials\n for their courses. They have committed to switching from the use of a traditional\n textbook to an OER or library-licensed resource in one of their classes. Each winner\n will receive a certificate and a $500 grant.\nThe SCoer Grant recipients are selected by Student Government representatives and\n members of the University Libraries.\nThe selection committee looks closely at three determining factors: applicants who\n showed a strong desire to learn the process of finding and using online educational\n resources, the potential for long-term financial savings for students, and the availability\n of OER materials on the subject taught, said , Scholarly Communication Librarian. These winners have shown great enthusiasm for\n using OER in their courses, and we congratulate them.\nMeet this year\u2019s winners:\n### Meredith DeBoom\nI am a first-generation college graduate ... When I began my career as an Assistant\n Professor at USC in Fall 2018, I made a commitment to myself that improving the inclusivity\n of higher education would be a priority in my career. Rather than walking away with\n an expensive textbook, I would much rather my students leave with a clear understanding\n of how they can apply geographic tools and theories in their careers. Incorporating\n open pedagogy techniques, as well as OERs, into GEOG 121 will enable me to design\n a course that is more relevant to my students\u2019 diverse academic and professional goals.\n### Austin Downey\nI want to use this program to help me to develop Open Educational Resources (OER)\n (textbook, code, and YouTube Videos) and a no-cost Mechanical Vibrations (EMCH 330)\n course that will be free of any copyright issues or software costs, allowing it to\n be freely shared.\nVibrations is an excellent candidate for OERs as the fundamentals do not change and\n the topic is taught at every institution and the basic theory of linear vibrations\n has not changed in 100 years.\n### Jennifer Pournelle\nAs a primary instructor for a Carolina Core science course open to all non-science\n majors, I have the privilege of working with a huge share of students unfamiliar with,\n and often terrified by, science terms and practices they view as mystifying and inapplicable.\n They all share wonder at and hope for the natural world around them - but cannot grasp\n the profound interrelationships among their own lives, other organisms, and the earth\n systems they cohabit. A huge percentage of my students work full time, are competitive\n athletes and performance artists, come from rural communities and low income families,\n with 'direct to job' majors. OER lets me help them see that 'environment' is wherever\n you are and whatever you do, and 'science' is a way of observing the here and now,\n and making decisions accordingly.\n### Timothy Shaw\nI have gotten permission to teach from the OpenStax text on a trial basis this fall\n and develop a slide set for later adoption in more sections based on the OER commons\n resources. I have looked into other schools that are using the OpenStax text and the\n book is both rigorous and popular. I hope in the future we can adapt problem sets\n to Blackboard to eliminate for sale online homework as well.\n \n## SCoer Grant Recipient\n\nMeredith DeBoom\n## SCoer Grant Recipient\n\nAustin Downey\n## SCoer Grant Recipient\n\nJennifer Pournelle\n## SCoer Grant Recipient\n\nTimothy Shaw\n\n\n[Learn more here](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/exhibits_events_news/news/scoer_2019.php)", "\n## Four faculty win SCoer! grants for 2018\nCongratulations to the four recipients of this year\u2019s SCoer!

The text is written and/or arranged in such a way that necessary updates will be relatively easy and straightforward to implement.\nClarity\nThe text is written in lucid, accessible prose, and provides adequate context for any jargon/technical terminology used.\nConsistency\nThe text is internally consistent in terms of terminology and framework.\nModularity\nThe text is easily and readily divisible into smaller reading sections that can be assigned at different points within the course (i.e., enormous blocks of text without subheadings should be avoided). The text should not be overly self-referential, and should be easily reorganized and realigned with various subunits of a course without presenting much disruption to the reader.\nOrganization/Structure/Flow\nThe topics in the text are presented in a logical, clear fashion.\nInterface\nThe text is free of significant interface issues, including navigation problems, distortion of images/charts, and any other display features that may distract or confuse the reader.\nGrammatical Errors\nThe text contains no grammatical errors.\nCultural Relevance\nThe text is not culturally insensitive or offensive in any way. It should make use of examples that are inclusive of a variety of races, ethnicities, and backgrounds.\n\nThis information is adapted from the [Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/reviews/rubric) and was originally developed by [BC Campus](http://open.bccampus.ca/).
