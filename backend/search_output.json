It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.   It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.  This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.  It can be called Distant Reading, but you should also do a close reading on a portion of the texts so that you are well informed on the content you are researching. \n## Terminology\nContent Mining is the overall concept of pulling together into one place a large corpus of text, data, or images from various sources and running scripts on them to answer a research question. \n- [Text Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining)is a research technique using computational analysis to uncover patterns in large text-based data sets. (Wikipedia)\n\n- [Data Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining)is to use machine-learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data (Wikipedia)\n\n- [Webscraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), web harvesting or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from web sites. The term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler.\n\n- [Machine learning ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)(ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. (Wikipedia)\n\n- Topic Modeling: A form of text mining to identify patterns or topics in a large corpus of text.[(Blei, 2012)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf)\n\n- [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)(NLP) is s process of programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language texts.\n## Getting Started\n- What is your?\n\n- Pull together aof support: librarians, computer programmers, statisticians are on campus and here to help.\n\n- These projects taketo pull together and perform.  Make sure you have this, especially for preparing the data.\n\n- Pull together a. This could be through:Scanning and OCRing contentScraping the webRequesting licensed data from a company or vendor.\n## Common Text Analysis Methods\n- : Most themes and words used throughout the text\n\n- Finding the most significant terms across documents\n\n- Finding connections or pairings of words\n\n- : Searhing for similar topics in many books, a long running diary, a whole run of a journal or periodical\n\n- : Mapping emotions in a body of texts\n\n \n## Storing and Creating Machine Readable Text\nYour data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.  In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text. PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.  Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.  TXT , TSV, or CSV are the best formats for working with data.\nIf your computer can no longer handle the size of the data set, contact DoIT [Research Computing ](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rc/index.php)about their high performance computing (HPC) options.\n\n- [DataFile Converter](https://www.withdata.com/data-file-converter/)\n- [How to convert PDFs to Text files](https://www.pdf2go.com/)\n- [Tesseract OCR software](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/)\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/text-analysis)", "\n## What is Machine Learning?\nA machine is said to be if its performance or efficiency for a given task improves with the experience (past data). Machine Learning uses advanced algorithms to analyze and learn relationships between the data to make intelligent decisions on what it has learned. The algorithms use a large amount of data to find the relationship. This relationship is called a which is used to make useful predictions or generate content from the data. \nFor example, we need physics-based mathematical equations of Earth's atmosphere to \npredict rainfall using traditional methods. Solving these complex equations requires massive computing resources and time, making the prediction task difficult. With the ML approach, we could provide enormous data to an ML model until the ML model eventually  the mathematical relationship between weather factors producing varying quantities of rain. If we give this model the current weather data, it would predict the amount of rain in the future.\n\nFigure 1 shows the difference between hardcoding the instructions to carry out a specific task versus using ML.\n\nAI system: Recommend songs to EVERYONE based on number of copies sold, top 10 in Billboard list, Grammy award winners, etc.\nML system: Recommend songs to each INDIVIDUAL based on previous songs played, other people with similar playlist, choice of singer, genre, etc.\nWhen using Machine Learning, Neural Networks, or Deep Learning, it is important to know the meaning of the following terms:\n- Refers to a specific problem or objective that the algorithm is designed to solve.\n\n- Set of rules that a machine follows to achieve a particular goal or the steps needed to get from the inputs to the output.\n\n- Observed/measured properties or characteristics of the data that are used as input to create a model.\n\n- : Variable whose value isorby the features; used in supervised learning.\n\n- It is theorof the target variable. If only 2 labels (such as 0 or 1, yes/no, hot/warm/cold).\n\n- Subset of data on which the model is initially trained.\n\n- Subset of data (distinct from training) that is used by the model to predict output and validate the model.\n\n- Subset of data (different from training and validation) on which model is tested.\n## What are the different types of Machine Learning?\nThere are 4 major types of ML problems:\n- Used for tasks where the target variable has defined labels or values.The target variable has 2 labels (binary class classification) or more (multiclass classification). For example:Whether USA will win or lose a match (binary).Gmail classifying email in classes like social, promotion, updates, or spam (multiclass).The output is numeric and has a continuous value and the task is to predict a value as closer to the actual output value. For example predict stock price of a stock.\n\n- Used for tasks where the target variable or output has no defined labels and hidden patterns in the data are discovered without human intervention.Discovering the inherent groupings in the data such as grouping customers by their purchasing behavior.Discover rules that describe large portions of the data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y\n\n- This is a hybrid technique between supervised and unsupervised learning, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data.\n\n- Learning happens by taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path to take in a specific situation. If there is no training data, it is bound to learn from its experience. Reward is defined by the experts.\n\nFigure (2) gives the example of  supervised and unsupervised Learning. In figure (2), the classification task is to predict if the user has purchased or not (1 or 0). The regression task is to predict the wind speed.\n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=1430013&p=10626775)", "\n## Academic Integrity and Student Conduct\n- [AI and Student Conduct/Academic Integrity](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_integrity/academic_integrity/artificial_intelligence/index.php)\n## AI Use in Teaching and Learning\n- [Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/generative_ai/index.php)\n## USC News & Events\n- [New projects explore AI in art and science](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/about/news/2023/artificial_intelligence.php)\n- [Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence](https://sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2023/05/artificial-intelligence.php)\n## Artificial Intelligence Institute at USC\n- [The Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://aiisc.ai/)\n## AI Degrees, Certificates, Courses\n- [Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/academics/graduate_programs/artificial_intelligence_certificate/index.php)The Artificial Intelligence Graduate Certificate is a 12-credit hour program comprised of core and elective courses.Major subjects include: Big Data Analytics, Robotics Systems, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Warehousing, Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs, Computer Processing and Natural Language, Pattern Recognition and Classification\n- [Artificial Intelligence Concentration](https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/engineering-computing/computer-science-engineering/computer-engineering-bse/#requirementstext)Computer Engineering, B.S.E.Computer Information Systems, B.S.Computer Science, B.S.C.S\n- [Information Technology, M.S.](https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/graduate/engineering-computing/integrated-information-technology/information-technology-ms/#requirementstext)ITEC 781 - Artificial Intelligence and Informatics IITEC 782 - Artificial Intelligence and Informatics II\n- [Course Listings](https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/search/?search=artificial+intelligence)CSCE 580 - Artificial IntelligenceCSCE 581 - Trusted Artificial IntelligenceENCP 788 - Independent Project in Artificial IntelligenceITEC 781 - Artificial Intelligence and Informatics IITEC 782 - Artificial Intelligence and Informatics IILAWS 851 - Artificial Intelligence, Law, Ethics, and Policy\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=1353979&p=10028526)", "\n## Introductory Tools\nThese are wonderful, easy to use tools to explore whether you want to learn more about text analysis.

You can generally find this information in the Instructions for Authors (or similar) section of the journal. These policies and guidelines are rapidly evolving, so be sure to check regularly for updates.\nWhile journal or publisher policies will always be your final determinant for whether or how you can use AI in developing your manuscript, a few best practices include:\n- Be transparent. Disclose and describe the use of AI in developing or author your manuscript.\n\n- Cite your use of the AI tool.\n\n- Be aware that AI can produce incorrect information and generate false citations. Carefully check the accuracy of content generated by the AI tool.\n\n[(Hosseini, M., Rasmussen, L. M., & Resnik, D.

The overall goal is to create intelligent systems that are capable of assisting humans in a wide variety of tasks and functions.\n## The Bots Explain Generative AI\n- [According to ChatGPT 3.5](#s-lib-ctab-31638843-0)\n\n- [According to Bing Chat](#s-lib-ctab-31638843-1)\n\n- [According to Bard](#s-lib-ctab-31638843-2)\n\n- [According to Claude.ai](#s-lib-ctab-31638843-3)\nGenerative AI, short for Generative Artificial Intelligence, is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating or generating new data, content, or artifacts. It's a field within AI that deals with models and algorithms capable of producing original, often human-like, content such as text, images, audio, and more. Generative AI systems work by learning patterns and structures from existing data and then using this knowledge to produce novel, coherent outputs.\nThere are various techniques and models used in generative AI, including:\n- : GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete with each other. The generator tries to create content (e.g., images) that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator attempts to differentiate between real and generated data. This adversarial training process results in the generation of increasingly convincing content.\n\n- : RNNs are a type of neural network that can generate sequences of data. They are often used in natural language generation and music composition tasks.\n\n- : VAEs are models that learn a probabilistic representation of data, which can be sampled to generate new data points. They are commonly used in image generation and data compression.\n\n- : Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that has been highly successful in natural language processing tasks. Variants like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) are capable of generating human-like text and have applications in text generation, chatbots, and more.\n\nGenerative AI has a wide range of practical applications, including:\n- : For generating human-like text in chatbots, content generation, and language translation.\n\n- : For creating art, generating images from textual descriptions, and more.\n\n- : Generating music in various styles and genres.\n\n- : Creating characters, levels, and scenarios in video games.\n\n- : Generating molecular structures for potential new drugs.\n\n- : Creating additional data for training machine learning models.\n\n- : Recommending products, movies, or music to users based on their preferences.\n\nWhile generative AI offers exciting possibilities, it also raises ethical concerns, especially when it comes to generating highly convincing but fake content, often referred to as deepfakes. Researchers and policymakers are actively working on guidelines and regulations to address these challenges in the field of generative AI.\nGenerative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content such as text, images, code, or other media using generative models. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics. \nGenerative AI can be used for various purposes such as enhancing creativity, synthesizing data, or manipulating content. For instance, generative AI can be used to create realistic images of non-existent objects or people. It can also be used to generate music or art that is unique and original.\nGenerative AI is a rapidly growing field with many applications in various industries. For example, it can be used in healthcare to generate synthetic data for research purposes. In finance, it can be used to generate synthetic financial data for fraud detection. In entertainment, it can be used to create personalized content recommendations for users based on their preferences.\nI hope this helps!\n is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, music, and code. It does this by learning the patterns and structures in existing data, and then using that knowledge to generate new data that is similar to the original data but not identical.\nGenerative AI models are typically trained on large datasets of existing data. For example, a text-generating AI model might be trained on a massive dataset of books, articles, and other text data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate new text, such as poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.\nGenerative AI has a wide range of potential applications, including:\n- : Generative AI can be used to create new and original content, such as news articles, blog posts, social media posts, and marketing materials.\n\n- : Generative AI can be used to design new products, buildings, and other objects.\n\n- : Generative AI can be used to generate synthetic data for research purposes, such as testing new drugs or developing new algorithms.\n\n- : Generative AI can be used to create new forms of entertainment, such as video games, movies, and music.\n\nGenerative AI is a rapidly developing field, and new applications are emerging all the time. It is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize many industries and aspects of our lives.\nHere are some examples of generative AI models:\n- : A large language model that can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\n\n- : A text-to-image diffusion model that can create realistic images and art from text descriptions.\n\n- : A music generation model that can create new musical pieces in a variety of styles.\n\n- : A code generation model that can generate code to solve programming problems.\n\nGenerative AI is a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize many industries and aspects of our lives. However, it is important to note that generative AI models can also be used to create harmful or misleading content, such as deepfakes. It is important to use generative AI responsibly and ethically.\nGenerative AI refers to a branch of artificial intelligence focused on using machine learning models to generate new content, such as text, images, audio, and video. The key aspects of generative AI include:\n- - These are machine learning algorithms trained on large datasets that allow them to identify patterns and generate new sample outputs similar to the training data. Common models include GANs, VAEs, autoregressive models like GPT-3.\n\n- - Models can generate human-like text for a variety of applications like conversational agents, summarization, content creation, and translation. Key techniques include predictive keyboards, autocorrection, autocomplete, and large language models like GPT-3.\n\n- - Models can create realistic images and edit existing images. This has applications in content creation, art generation, manipulating media, and computer vision. Models include GANs, VAEs, diffusion models.\n\n- - Models can synthesize realistic human speech and music. Key applications are text-to-speech, voice cloning, music information retrieval, and voice synthesis for digital assistants.\n\n- - Models can generate artificial but realistic videos and edit existing videos. This has applications in media editing, content creation, and computer vision.\n\nIn summary, generative AI leverages the creativity of machine learning models to produce novel, original and realistic content across different media types for a wide variety of applications. It allows systems to go beyond analyzing data to synthesizing and creating new data points.\n \n\n\n[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=1353979&p=10024205)", "\n## American Medical Association (AMA) Citation Style 11th ed.\nThese guidelines are based on the 11th edition of the AMA Manual of Style.
