      To search the South Caroliniana Library's collections, please start with our online catalog, which can be found on our [main webpage](http://sc.edu/libraries/scl).
      To search by keyword, enter keywords in the search box and click search. Or, you can follow the link below the search box to [Advanced Search](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01PASCAL_USCCOL:USC&mode=advanced). There you will be able to search specific fields within the catalog records and build searches with AND, OR, or NOT.
      In your first results page, you may limit your results further to physical and digital items held by University Libraries, including South Caroliniana Library, by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the search box where it says Articles, Books and More, choosing USC Libraries, and clicking the magnifying glass search icon to refresh your results. Then, if you wish to limit specifically to items within South Caroliniana Library's collections, click the checkboxes to choose all locations that have South Caroliniana as part of their name under the Location menu (at the left of the screen on a computer or under the filters icon on your phone). This may not seem intuitive, but choosing locations containing South Caroliniana returns a complete set of South Caroliniana Library materials, while choosing South Caroliniana Library under Library does not always return a complete set.
      There might be materials within [South Carolina Political Collections](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/sc_political_collections/index.php) or [Oral History](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/oral_history/index.php) related to your topic as well. To include these in your catalog search results, please choose South Carolina Political Collections or Columbia Oral History as locations. Note, if there are no search results within these locations, the option to select them will not appear.
      To point out a particular collection or item in a collection found in our catalog, we recommend including the Permalink. From the catalog record, click the PERMALINK icon under Tools. Then copy and paste the link into your email.
      In addition to [searching our catalog](https://sc.edu/libraries/scl), you can [search finding aids to many of our larger collections in ArchivesSpace](https://archives.library.sc.edu/).

      First, please take a look at [Do you have resources I can use to research my family's genealogy?
      If you are able to determine the name of a plantation, family, or person who may have held an ancestor of yours in enslavement, you can look to see if South Caroliniana Library holds antebellum papers from that person, family, or plantation, which might include names of enslaved persons.
      They are organized by area, so if you have an idea of where a formerly enslaved ancestor may have lived, you might be able to find a record of them from immediately after the Civil War.

  - text: |
      First, please take a look at [Do you have resources I can use to research my family's genealogy?](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/scl/faq/372588)
      Here are some additional suggestions.
      Past records of the [United States Census are available through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/census). The 1870 census is the first in which formerly enslaved African Americans were listed by name. The 1850 and 1860 censuses included slave schedules listing numbers of enslaved persons held by particular enslavers along with their sex, color (black or mulatto), and age, but without their names.
      If you are able to determine the name of a plantation, family, or person who may have held an ancestor of yours in enslavement, you can look to see if South Caroliniana Library holds antebellum papers from that person, family, or plantation, which might include names of enslaved persons. We also hold series A and B of the Records of ante-bellum Southern Plantations on microfilm. (These are available also from [other libraries](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12894903).) We can provide an index to these records, or you can see the lists of names in the two series, [Series A](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/564176) and [Series B](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/559181), as provided by FamilySearch.org.
      Records kept by the Freedmen's Bureau after the Civil War often contain labor contracts between recently-freed African Americans and land owners, who were sometimes their former enslavers. They are organized by area, so if you have an idea of where a formerly enslaved ancestor may have lived, you might be able to find a record of them from immediately after the Civil War. Freedmen's Bureau records are available several places online:
      [The Freedmen's Bureau holdings at the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/freedmens-bureau)
      [The Freedmen's Bureau Records at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/initiatives/freedmens-bureau-records)
      [The Freemen's Bureau Digital Collection in the Smithsonian Online Virtual Archives](https://sova.si.edu/record/NMAAHC.FB)
      [The Freedmen's Bureau Online](http://www.freedmensbureau.com/)
      The [South Carolina Department of Archives and History](https://scdah.sc.gov/) has a [page of resources for African American genealogy](https://scdah.sc.gov/research-and-genealogy/resources/african-american-genealogy).
      And the [International African American Museum](https://iaamuseum.org/) in Charleston, S.C., has a [Center for Family History](https://iaamuseum.org/center-for-family-history/).
      Some genealogists find that they wish to employ a professional researcher to assist with their family history. Please [contact us](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/form?queue_id=6117) if you would like a list of researchers who have provided their contact information for us to give out.

      South Caroliniana Library may have primary resource documents, published genealogical works, and genealogical collections that could help you in researching families in South Carolina.
      To search our collections, please start with our online catalog, which can be found on our [main webpage](http://sc.edu/libraries/scl).
      To search by keyword, enter keywords in the search box and click search. Or, you can follow the link below the search box to [Advanced Search](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01PASCAL_USCCOL:USC&mode=advanced). There you will be able to search specific fields within the catalog records and build searches with AND, OR, or NOT.
      In your first results page, you may limit your results further to physical and digital items held by University Libraries, including South Caroliniana Library, by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the search box where it says Articles, Books and More, choosing UofSC Libraries, and clicking the magnifying glass search icon to refresh your results. Then, if you wish to limit specifically to items within South Caroliniana Library's collections, click the checkboxes to choose all locations that have South Caroliniana as part of their name under the Location menu (at the left of the screen on a computer or under the filters icon on your phone). This may not seem intuitive, but choosing locations containing South Caroliniana returns a complete set of South Caroliniana Library Collections, while choosing South Caroliniana Library under Library does not always return a complete set.
      To point out a particular collection or item in a collection found in our catalog, we recommend including the Permalink. From the catalog record, click the PERMALINK icon under Tools. Then copy and paste the link into your email.
      In addition to [searching our catalog](https://sc.edu/libraries/scl), you can [search finding aids to many of our larger collections](https://archives.library.sc.edu/repositories/3). This includes our larger genealogical collections that may include folders on particular surnames. Just put your surnames into the search box. Don't forget to also search variant spellings you might find in your family tree. Here, rather than finding a permalink to copy and paste, copy instead the URL from the address bar of your browser and paste it into your email.
      We also have South Carolina Magazine of Ancestral Research ([catalog record here](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01PASCAL_USCCOL/1oceqbt/alma991010493299705618)) through 2020. This magazine presents transcriptions of records from various sources that include important names and dates such as marriages, deaths, property transfers, court actions, etc. It is not available online, but is available in our Reading Room by appointment.
      Many genealogists find that [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com) is a useful resource, especially if they are just starting out. It is a subscription service and in no way affiliated with South Carolinana Library or the University of South Carolina. Often public libraries offer free access to Ancestry. And you might also want to investigate other possible resources at your public library.
      Past records of the [United States Census are available through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/census).
      State and some county records and other resources can be found at the [South Carolina Department of Archives and History](https://scdah.sc.gov/). Their website includes excellent guidance for genealogists.
      Some genealogists find that they wish to employ a professional researcher to assist with their family history. Please [contact us](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/form?queue_id=6117) if you would like a list of researchers who have provided their contact information for us to give out.

      USC Parking
      A visitor's parking permit is available from [USC Parking](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/parking/index.php) for $10 per day. This will allow you to park in most surface lots on campus except in parking spaces marked as reserved, including parking in the [C1 Faculty and Staff lot](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204265) at 1400 Pendleton Street, next to the back garden of the South Caroliniana Library, and the [C2 Faculty and Staff lot](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204122?share) at 901 Sumter Street, north of the James F. Byrnes building and across Sumter Street from South Caroliniana Library.
      Without a visitor's parking permit, the [C1](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204265) and [C2](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204122?share) Faculty and Staff lots are restricted to University of South Carolina faculty and staff with a C, H or RT permit until 3 p.m. on weekdays. But all faculty and staff permit holders can park there after 3 p.m. And all faculty, staff, and student permit holders can park there on Saturdays.
      University parking is also available to visitors in the [Pendleton Street Garage](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204274). The visitors' entrance to the garage is on the west side of the 1000 block of Pickens Street, at the northeast corner of the garage. Visitors' parking is at five-hour meters on levels 1a, 1b, and 2a for up to $1 per hour, depending on payment method. Parking meter cards valid for one full day at any USC meter are available for $5 at the Parking and Transportation Services office on the ground level at the southeast corner of the Pendleton Street Garage. Payment at USC meters is not monitored on Saturday. Note, meters on the street are not University meters, but are maintained by the City of Columbia.
      For more information on University parking, visit [Parking and Transportation Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/parking/index.php).
      City of Columbia parking
      [Parking monitored by the City of Columbia](https://parking.columbiasc.gov/) is available on surrounding streets at two-hour green meters and five-hour blue meters for 25 cents per 20 minutes, or with the Passport Parking app using your smart phone as explained [here](https://parking.columbiasc.gov/enforcement/). Time may not be added to the meters beyond their maximum. Two-hour green meters are on Marion, on Senate between Sumter and Marion, and on the north side of College. Five-hour blue meters are on the south side of College, on Sumter between Greene and Pendleton, on Pendleton between Sumter and Bull, and on Senate between Marion and Bull. The city offers an [interactive map](https://gis.columbiasc.gov/parking/) that shows green and blue lines for the different types of meters. To center the map on South Caroliniana Library, search for 910 Sumter St.
      Privately-maintained public parking
      [Vista Parking](http://www.vistaparkingsc.com/) maintains a parking lot on the block behind South Caroliniana Library at [1311 Pendleton Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WgJWZgv5Foft9wqq9) at the corner with Sumter Street with both monthly and hourly rates using your smart phone.

      Other parking
      There is a state employee parking lot at the [corner of Pendleton and Marion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BipFrGWJo8aY77KN7). The signage indicates that parking is restricted to state employees by law / 6:00 A.M. - 6:00 P.M. Mon - Fri / no public parking. Many patrons report parking here on Saturdays without consequence; but given the ambiguity in the signage, we advise proceeding at your own risk.
      Parking for people who have a disability
      Persons with valid parking placards or license plates for people with disabilities may park in any street metered spaces maintained by the City of Columbia without feeding the meter and without time restrictions.
      To park in accessible spaces marked as USC permit-only parking lots or garages, a USC permit, in conjunction with a state issued-placard is required. State-issued placards or plates alone are not valid to park in these spaces.
      The visitor parking spaces in the Pendleton Street Garage include accessible parking spaces that may be used by those with state-issued placards or plates. These spaces are not marked as USC-permit only, but may require payment. However, please note there is an approximately 0.4 mile distance between the garage and South Caroliniana Library building.

As mentioned above, a $10 per day visitor's parking permit will allow you to park in most surface lots on campus in most spaces, except those marked as reserved. This includes parking the [C1 Faculty and Staff lot](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204265) at 1400 Pendleton Street, next to the back garden of the South Caroliniana Library.

      The 2010 trademark case between the University of South Carolina and the University of Southern California was not over the use of USC. It was over the use of the interlocking SC letters as an athletic logo.
      Southern California uses an interlocking block SC for its athletic teams, while South Carolina uses an interlocking script SC, which was based on historical designs over a century old. Southern California argued that fans would be confused by a burgundy block SC and a garnet script SC. The University Archives provided documentation of the historical usage of the interlocking SC at the University of South Carolina, but Southern California won the case because in the 1980s the longstanding usage of SC and South Carolina to represent this university were dropped in favor of using USC (and The USC). The judge ruled we had abandoned the mark. Carolina can still use the logo, it just can't be trademarked.

You should see a separate charge for the actual cost of your printing.
      Bank Policies:
      Depending on the policies of your specific bank, it can take anywhere from 1 to 8 business days for authorization holds to expire. You can contact them to see if they can tell you what to expect. If having these holds on your debit card is not convenient, you may consider keeping a small balance of CarolinaCash to use instead for low-cost print jobs.
