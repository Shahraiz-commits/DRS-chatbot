      First, please take a look at [Do you have resources I can use to research my family's genealogy?](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/scl/faq/372588)
      Here are some additional suggestions.
      Past records of the [United States Census are available through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/census).
      The 1870 census is the first in which formerly enslaved African Americans were listed by name.
      The 1850 and 1860 censuses included slave schedules listing numbers of enslaved persons held by particular enslavers along with their sex, color (black or mulatto), and age, but without their names.

      Data often have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them.
      Researchers may continue to work on data after funding has ceased, follow-up projects may analyse or add to the data, and data may be re-used by other researchers.
      Well organised, well documented, preserved and shared data are invaluable to advance scientific inquiry and to increase opportunities for learning and innovation.

      Metadata is information about the context, content, quality, provenance, and/or accessibility of a dataset.
      In order for your data to be accessible to you, your colleagues, and other researchers, it must be properly documented.
      Put simply, metadata is data about your data.
      - Make a note of all file names and formats associated with the project, how the data are organized, how the data were generated (including any equipment or software used), and information about how the data have been altered or processed.

  utter_consistent_file_naming_strategy:
  - text: |2-

      Developing and following a consistent file naming strategy can make data easier to find, particularly when large numbers of files exist.
      Although it's common to think that file names will be remembered in the future, unorganized files and folders can lead to frustration down the road.
      Good file naming allows you to identify the contents of the file from the name.
      It may be useful to consider including some or all of the following information, as long as it is done consistently.

      As anyone with data saved on a floppy disk probably realizes, technology changes constantly and, if not planned for, hardware and software obsolescence can render data inaccessible and unreadable.
      To ensure long-term accessibility of research data, researchers should consider using file formats that share these characteristics:
      - Non-proprietary
      - Open, documented standard

      ##### Regulation and Security
      Hardware failure, virus infection, hacking, and loss or theft of hardware are all common realities that can have a devastating effect on research if proper back-up hasn't taken place.
      See the [UK Data Archive's guidelines on Backing-up Data](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/store.aspx) for more information.
      While storage refers to ways of preserving files for the short- or long-term, back-up refers to preserving copies of your files in different physical locations and using different media to protect against data loss.
      It states that at least 3 total copies of data should exist, 2 of which are local but on different media (devices), and at least 1 copy should be stored offsite.

  - text: |2-

      While information security is concerned with protection, privacy is concerned with the sensitivity of data, the justification for collecting data, and decisions about notification and sharing.
      International, Federal, and State legislation and regulations may apply.
      Privacy issues vary greatly by location and subject matter of data, posing significant liabilities, especially with regard to protected personal information (PPI) and personal identifying information (PII).

      ##### What is Machine Learning?
      A machine is said to be "learning" if its performance or efficiency for a given task improves with the experience (past data).
      Machine Learning uses advanced algorithms to analyze and learn relationships between the data to make intelligent decisions on what it has learned.
      The algorithms use a large amount of data to find the relationship.
      This relationship is called a which is used to make useful predictions or generate content from the data.

      ##### What are the different types of Machine Learning?
      There are 4 major types of ML problems:
      - **Supervised learning** is used for tasks where the target variable has defined labels or values.The target variable has 2 labels (binary class classification) or more (multiclass classification).
      For example: Whether USA will win or lose a match (binary).Gmail classifying email in classes like social, promotion, updates, or spam (multiclass).The output is numeric and has a continuous value and the task is to predict a value as closer to the actual output value.
      For example predict stock price of a stock.

      ##### Generative AI Image/Art generators
      The goal of an AI art generator is to take a text prompt and turn it into an image that represents the prompt.
      Comparable to LLMs (large language models), art generators use vast image-text pair content models to discern and learn image meanings and characteristics.
      Ultimately, they render a resulting image using either a diffusion model or generative adversarial networks (GANS).
      Unlike the major generative AI chatbots, most generative AI art generators have limited or no free access.

      ##### What is It?
      Text mining is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets.
      It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.
      It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.
      This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.

      ##### Managing Open Access Journals
      - Who will serve as journal manager, the person who is primarily responsible for this journal during the planning stages and after the journal has launched? You will likely need a managing editor to create and publish journal issues, monitor submissions, and assign peer-reviewers.
      You may  need section editors to manage specific articles.
      Additionally, you will need production staff who handle tasks such as copyediting, layout, and proofing.
      You'll also likely need an editorial board, authors, and reviewers.While there certainly can be overlap in these roles (for example, you may choose to ask your editorial board to act as reviewers or content shepherds) and you don't necessarily need to have names in place to start the journal creation process, keep in mind tht these roles will continue to be necessary throughout the life of the journal.

      ##### Copyright Basics
      Information and educational tools on this website are offered to assist faculty, staff, and students of the University in making good decisions about the appropriate use of copyrighted materials.
      The Copyright Law (Title 17 of the US Code) exists to grant certain rights to content creators.
      It allows them the control over copies, derivative works, public display, public performance, and transmission of their works.
      Copyright law attempts to balance the need to establish incentive for content creators to profit from their work, and thus have incentive to continue to create, with the additional need for society to have some rights to these works such as the right to criticize, parody, and use for education.

      ##### Making Copyright Decisions
      Is the work covered by copyright or could it be part of the [Public Domain](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/publicdomain)?
      Ideas, facts, processes, and concepts cannot be copyrighted.
      Works must meet a minimal level of originality to be able to be copyrighted.
      Many works are in the public domain, which means they are free to be used by all.

      It's important to understand the differences in the types of repositories to determine which is most appropriate for sharing your work.
      While there is some overlap between repository types, the three main types are:

      Institutional repositories (IRs) are repositories that are hosted and managed by educational institutions.
      They exist to preserve and share the scholarly output of an educational institution.

      It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works.
      But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which?

      Social networking sites for academics, such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate, are used by some researchers to share their scholarly works and monitor analytics across disciplines.
      These sites are often used as social media and outreach tools.
      Because these types of sites have been regularly accused by publishers of [massive copyright infringement](http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/), it's important that researchers pay close attention to the terms of service and privacy policies of these sites.
      The University of California Office of Scholarly Communication provides a [great read on the differences between academic social networking sites and open access repositories](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2015/12/a-social-networking-site-is-not-an-open-access-repository/?utm_source=hootsuite).

      This broad and flexible doctrine provides instances for when using copyrighted material may be deemed fair.

      Meet this year’s winners:
      I wrote a free textbook for upper-level robotics courses, but do not have experience identifying, selecting, and utilizing OER created by others, especially for lower-level courses like my UNIX/Linux Fundamentals course.
      The subject of this course is one that lends itself well to OER, compared to other aspects of computer science, because there is a long history and plenty of free materials.
      Students have told me that the current traditional textbooks are not helpful, so I suspect that an OER format may both improve learning outcomes and reduce the costs for students.
      After years of teaching at UofSC, I can clearly identify the potential benefits of using affordable and accessible resources into my own classes.
