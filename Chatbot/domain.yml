      To search the South Caroliniana Library's collections, please start with our online catalog, which can be found on our [main webpage](http://sc.edu/libraries/scl).
      To search by keyword, enter keywords in the search box and click search. Or, you can follow the link below the search box to [Advanced Search](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01PASCAL_USCCOL:USC&mode=advanced). There you will be able to search specific fields within the catalog records and build searches with AND, OR, or NOT.
      In your first results page, you may limit your results further to physical and digital items held by University Libraries, including South Caroliniana Library, by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the search box where it says Articles, Books and More, choosing USC Libraries, and clicking the magnifying glass search icon to refresh your results. Then, if you wish to limit specifically to items within South Caroliniana Library's collections, click the checkboxes to choose all locations that have South Caroliniana as part of their name under the Location menu (at the left of the screen on a computer or under the filters icon on your phone). This may not seem intuitive, but choosing locations containing South Caroliniana returns a complete set of South Caroliniana Library materials, while choosing South Caroliniana Library under Library does not always return a complete set.
      There might be materials within [South Carolina Political Collections](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/sc_political_collections/index.php) or [Oral History](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/oral_history/index.php) related to your topic as well. To include these in your catalog search results, please choose South Carolina Political Collections or Columbia Oral History as locations. Note, if there are no search results within these locations, the option to select them will not appear.
      To point out a particular collection or item in a collection found in our catalog, we recommend including the Permalink. From the catalog record, click the PERMALINK icon under Tools. Then copy and paste the link into your email.
      In addition to [searching our catalog](https://sc.edu/libraries/scl), you can [search finding aids to many of our larger collections in ArchivesSpace](https://archives.library.sc.edu/). You can search all repositories or [limit to specific repositories](https://archives.library.sc.edu/repositories), such as [the South Caroliniana Library](https://archives.library.sc.edu/repositories/south_caroliniana_library), [South Carolina Political Collections](https://archives.library.sc.edu/repositories/south_carolina_political_collections), or [Oral History](https://archives.library.sc.edu/repositories/office_of_oral_history_1). Here, rather than finding a permalink to copy and paste, copy instead the URL from the address bar of your browser and paste it into your email.
      We also have online [South Caroliniana Library Digital Collections](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/digital_collections/collections/index.php?search=caroliniana), [South Carolina Political Collections Digital Collections](https://digital.library.sc.edu/departments/scpc/), [Oral HIstory Online Collections](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/oral_history/collections/index.php?search=digital), and the [Historical Newspapers of South Carolina](https://historicnewspapers.sc.edu).
      If you have questions, please [contact us](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/form?queue_id=6117).
      Please also see [How can I see collection materials from South Caroliniana Library?](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/scl/faq/372586)

      We set research appointments in the Charles W. Joyner Reading Room at the South Caroliniana Library during our open hours of 9 a.m. until 4 p.m., Tuesdays through Fridays, and the first Saturday of each month, subject to appointment availability. We are closed to the public on Sundays, Mondays, and Saturdays except for the first Saturday of each month. ([Please check here for holidays and exceptions.](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/about/hours/index.php)) 
      Please let us know what date and time would like to arrive and approximately when you plan to leave. We will need a list of the materials you wish to view by 12 noon (ET) at least three weekdays in advance to ensure we have time to locate all materials and bring anything that is stored offsite to the reading room. (For example, if you request materials by 12 noon on Monday, we can usually set your appointment as early as Thursday. If after noon on Monday but before noon on Tuesday, we can set your appointment for Friday.)
      If visiting us in person is not convenient, we offer an hour of research-quality scanning at no charge. See [How can I see collection materials from South Caroliniana Library](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/scl/faq/372586)?
      Just [contact us here](http://libanswers.library.sc.edu/form?queue_id=6117) when you're ready. 
      Please note that items that are part of the [South Carolina Political Collections](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/sc_political_collections/index.php) are not accessible at the South Caroliniana Library, but may be viewed by appointment only in the [Dorothy B. Smith Reading Room](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/about/locations/hollings/smith_reading_room/index.php) in the [Ernest F. Hollings Special Collections Library](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/about/locations/hollings/index.php), Please visit the [Ernest F. Hollings Special Collections Library](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/about/locations/hollings/index.php) for information on hours.

  utter_african_american_ancestry_suggestion:
  - text: |
      First, please take a look at [Do you have resources I can use to research my family's genealogy?](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/scl/faq/372588)
      Here are some additional suggestions.
      Past records of the [United States Census are available through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/census). The 1870 census is the first in which formerly enslaved African Americans were listed by name. The 1850 and 1860 censuses included slave schedules listing numbers of enslaved persons held by particular enslavers along with their sex, color (black or mulatto), and age, but without their names.
      If you are able to determine the name of a plantation, family, or person who may have held an ancestor of yours in enslavement, you can look to see if South Caroliniana Library holds antebellum papers from that person, family, or plantation, which might include names of enslaved persons. We also hold series A and B of the Records of ante-bellum Southern Plantations on microfilm. (These are available also from [other libraries](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12894903).) We can provide an index to these records, or you can see the lists of names in the two series, [Series A](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/564176) and [Series B](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/559181), as provided by FamilySearch.org.
      Records kept by the Freedmen's Bureau after the Civil War often contain labor contracts between recently-freed African Americans and land owners, who were sometimes their former enslavers. They are organized by area, so if you have an idea of where a formerly enslaved ancestor may have lived, you might be able to find a record of them from immediately after the Civil War. Freedmen's Bureau records are available several places online:
      [The Freedmen's Bureau holdings at the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/freedmens-bureau)
      [The Freedmen's Bureau Records at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/initiatives/freedmens-bureau-records)

      South Caroliniana Library may have primary resource documents, published genealogical works, and genealogical collections that could help you in researching families in South Carolina.
      To search our collections, please start with our online catalog, which can be found on our [main webpage](http://sc.edu/libraries/scl).
      To search by keyword, enter keywords in the search box and click search. Or, you can follow the link below the search box to [Advanced Search](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01PASCAL_USCCOL:USC&mode=advanced). There you will be able to search specific fields within the catalog records and build searches with AND, OR, or NOT.
      In your first results page, you may limit your results further to physical and digital items held by University Libraries, including South Caroliniana Library, by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the search box where it says Articles, Books and More, choosing UofSC Libraries, and clicking the magnifying glass search icon to refresh your results. Then, if you wish to limit specifically to items within South Caroliniana Library's collections, click the checkboxes to choose all locations that have South Caroliniana as part of their name under the Location menu (at the left of the screen on a computer or under the filters icon on your phone). This may not seem intuitive, but choosing locations containing South Caroliniana returns a complete set of South Caroliniana Library Collections, while choosing South Caroliniana Library under Library does not always return a complete set.
      To point out a particular collection or item in a collection found in our catalog, we recommend including the Permalink. From the catalog record, click the PERMALINK icon under Tools. Then copy and paste the link into your email.
      In addition to [searching our catalog](https://sc.edu/libraries/scl), you can [search finding aids to many of our larger collections](https://archives.library.sc.edu/repositories/3). This includes our larger genealogical collections that may include folders on particular surnames. Just put your surnames into the search box. Don't forget to also search variant spellings you might find in your family tree. Here, rather than finding a permalink to copy and paste, copy instead the URL from the address bar of your browser and paste it into your email.
      We also have South Carolina Magazine of Ancestral Research ([catalog record here](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01PASCAL_USCCOL/1oceqbt/alma991010493299705618)) through 2020. This magazine presents transcriptions of records from various sources that include important names and dates such as marriages, deaths, property transfers, court actions, etc. It is not available online, but is available in our Reading Room by appointment.
      Many genealogists find that [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com) is a useful resource, especially if they are just starting out. It is a subscription service and in no way affiliated with South Carolinana Library or the University of South Carolina. Often public libraries offer free access to Ancestry. And you might also want to investigate other possible resources at your public library.
      Past records of the [United States Census are available through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/census).
      State and some county records and other resources can be found at the [South Carolina Department of Archives and History](https://scdah.sc.gov/). Their website includes excellent guidance for genealogists.

      USC Parking
      A visitor's parking permit is available from [USC Parking](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/parking/index.php) for $10 per day. This will allow you to park in most surface lots on campus except in parking spaces marked as reserved, including parking in the [C1 Faculty and Staff lot](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204265) at 1400 Pendleton Street, next to the back garden of the South Caroliniana Library, and the [C2 Faculty and Staff lot](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204122?share) at 901 Sumter Street, north of the James F. Byrnes building and across Sumter Street from South Caroliniana Library.
      Without a visitor's parking permit, the [C1](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204265) and [C2](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204122?share) Faculty and Staff lots are restricted to University of South Carolina faculty and staff with a C, H or RT permit until 3 p.m. on weekdays. But all faculty and staff permit holders can park there after 3 p.m. And all faculty, staff, and student permit holders can park there on Saturdays.
      University parking is also available to visitors in the [Pendleton Street Garage](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204274). The visitors' entrance to the garage is on the west side of the 1000 block of Pickens Street, at the northeast corner of the garage. Visitors' parking is at five-hour meters on levels 1a, 1b, and 2a for up to $1 per hour, depending on payment method. Parking meter cards valid for one full day at any USC meter are available for $5 at the Parking and Transportation Services office on the ground level at the southeast corner of the Pendleton Street Garage. Payment at USC meters is not monitored on Saturday. Note, meters on the street are not University meters, but are maintained by the City of Columbia.
      For more information on University parking, visit [Parking and Transportation Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/parking/index.php).
      City of Columbia parking
      [Parking monitored by the City of Columbia](https://parking.columbiasc.gov/) is available on surrounding streets at two-hour green meters and five-hour blue meters for 25 cents per 20 minutes, or with the Passport Parking app using your smart phone as explained [here](https://parking.columbiasc.gov/enforcement/). Time may not be added to the meters beyond their maximum. Two-hour green meters are on Marion, on Senate between Sumter and Marion, and on the north side of College. Five-hour blue meters are on the south side of College, on Sumter between Greene and Pendleton, on Pendleton between Sumter and Bull, and on Senate between Marion and Bull. The city offers an [interactive map](https://gis.columbiasc.gov/parking/) that shows green and blue lines for the different types of meters. To center the map on South Caroliniana Library, search for 910 Sumter St.
      Privately-maintained public parking
      [Vista Parking](http://www.vistaparkingsc.com/) maintains a parking lot on the block behind South Caroliniana Library at [1311 Pendleton Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WgJWZgv5Foft9wqq9) at the corner with Sumter Street with both monthly and hourly rates using your smart phone.
      [Preferred Parking](https://www.preferredparking.com/2019_Columbia.html) maintains parking lots at [1212 Pendleton Street](https://www.preferredparking.com/dailyparking_regional/default.aspx?lat=33.99903&long=-81.02966&zoom=17) and [1320 Senate Street](https://www.preferredparking.com/dailyparking_regional/default.aspx?lat=33.99903&long=-81.02966&zoom=17) with both monthly and hourly rates using your smart phone.
      Other parking
      There is a state employee parking lot at the [corner of Pendleton and Marion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BipFrGWJo8aY77KN7). The signage indicates that parking is restricted to state employees by law / 6:00 A.M. - 6:00 P.M. Mon - Fri / no public parking. Many patrons report parking here on Saturdays without consequence; but given the ambiguity in the signage, we advise proceeding at your own risk.
      Parking for people who have a disability
      Persons with valid parking placards or license plates for people with disabilities may park in any street metered spaces maintained by the City of Columbia without feeding the meter and without time restrictions.
      To park in accessible spaces marked as USC permit-only parking lots or garages, a USC permit, in conjunction with a state issued-placard is required. State-issued placards or plates alone are not valid to park in these spaces.
      The visitor parking spaces in the Pendleton Street Garage include accessible parking spaces that may be used by those with state-issued placards or plates. These spaces are not marked as USC-permit only, but may require payment. However, please note there is an approximately 0.4 mile distance between the garage and South Caroliniana Library building.
      The [C1 Faculty and Staff lot](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204265) at 1400 Pendleton Street has accessible spaces next to the back garden of the South Caroliniana Library that may be used with a valid USC parking permit in conjunction with a state-issued placard. As mentioned above, a $10 per day visitor's parking permit will allow you to park in most surface lots on campus in most spaces, except those marked as reserved. This includes parking the [C1 Faculty and Staff lot](https://sc.edu/visit/map/?id=744#!m/204265) at 1400 Pendleton Street, next to the back garden of the South Caroliniana Library.

      Incorrect or unsupported file type
       Only files stored as MS Word (.doc), PDF, JPEG or HTML can be uploaded. If you are trying to print from Google Docs you will have to download and save the file in one of these formats first. The same is true for PowerPoint files and Pages documents (on Macs). You will need to save as PDF or other supported file type.

      Your CarolinaCard is your library card. You need it to enter the library and check out books.
      On the Columbia Campus, you can get a CarolinaCard at their office in the basement of the Russell House. If you are unable to come to campus, Distributed Learning Support Services can issue you a library ID card.
      Students at a distance can take advantage of most library resources by signing in with their network username and password without needing a CarolinaCard. See the link below to learn more about accessing resources from off campus.
      If you are not currently affiliated with the University of South Carolina, you can get borrowing privileges by joining either the USC Alumni Association or Friends of the University Libraries.

      To access the eduroam wireless network, you must use your Network username with @ds.sc.edu added to the end. Your Network password is the same as your email password.
      The most common problem that is NOT related to general capacity or hardware issues is that your password has expired and needs to be updated. Use the link below for help when your password is not working.
      Note: Even if your password has been updated, often your computer has stored an expired password and is not prompting you to enter your new password.
      PC users: Right-click to Forget this network and then reconnect. Enter updated login information.
      Mac users: Uï»¿n-check Connect automatically and then reconnect. If it asks to use your Keychain stored password say no and re-enter your most recent login information.

      Books borrowed through Interlibrary Loan
      If the ILL Express! band on your borrowed item indicates that renewals are allowed, you can request a renewal through your Interlibrary Loan account.
      The final decision on granting a renewal rests with the lending library, and only one renewal per item is allowed. You won't be able to renew an item until five days or less before the original due date.
      For questions about ILL renewals, contact Interlibrary Loan at 803-777-2805 or [uscill@mailbox.sc.edu](mailto:uscill@mailbox.sc.edu)

  - text: |
      The 2010 trademark case between the University of South Carolina and the University of Southern California was not over the use of USC. It was over the use of the interlocking SC letters as an athletic logo.
      Southern California uses an interlocking block SC for its athletic teams, while South Carolina uses an interlocking script SC, which was based on historical designs over a century old. Southern California argued that fans would be confused by a burgundy block SC and a garnet script SC. The University Archives provided documentation of the historical usage of the interlocking SC at the University of South Carolina, but Southern California won the case because in the 1980s the longstanding usage of SC and South Carolina to represent this university were dropped in favor of using USC (and The USC). The judge ruled we had abandoned the mark. Carolina can still use the logo, it just can't be trademarked.

      Using Student Printing Kiosks:
      When using a credit or debit card on Student Printing Kiosks, you first choose an authorization amount to cover your printing costs. This will put a temporary charge on your card that will expire. If the charge shows as Pending or Processing with your bank, that is not a posted charge, and you can expect it to be removed or refunded. You should see a separate charge for the actual cost of your printing.
      Bank Policies:
      Depending on the policies of your specific bank, it can take anywhere from 1 to 8 business days for authorization holds to expire. You can contact them to see if they can tell you what to expect. If having these holds on your debit card is not convenient, you may consider keeping a small balance of CarolinaCash to use instead for low-cost print jobs.
      Request a Refund:
      You must wait until a Pending or Processing charge posts to your account to request a refund. If a charge posts to your account that is incorrect, or you have other issues with Student Printing Kiosks, fill out the online help form below.

  utter_difference_data_statistic:

      ## Data vs Statistics
      is raw information from which statistics are created.
      provides a summary and interpretation of the data.

      #### Data
      - Datasets

      - Machine-readable data files, data files for statistical software programs

      If you want to understand a phenomenon, you want data. Data can be analyzed and interpreted using statistical procedures to answer why or how. Data is used to create new information and knowledge.
      Raw data is the direct result of research that was conducted as part of a study or survey. It is a primary source. It usually comes in the form of a digital data set that can be analyzed using software such as Excel, , , and so on. This is what a data set looks like:

      #### Statistics
      - Statistical tables, charts, and graphs

      - Reported numbers and percentages in an article

      If youâ€™re looking for a quick number, you want a statistic. A statistic will answer how much or how many. A statistic repeats a pre-defined observation about reality.
      Statistics are the results of data analysis. It usually comes in the form of a table or chart. This is what a statistical table looks like:

      Source: [Statistical Abstract of the United States](http://statabs.proquest.com/sa/abstract.html?table-no=1082&acc-no=C7095-1.23&year=2015&z=04AFC9F8FF309B74767FB34B794047B78C6C1284)

  utter_open_data:
  - text: |
      #### Open data is data that is freely available for use or distribution by anyone. It is research data that:
      - Is freely available on the internet;
      - Permits any user to download, copy, analyze, re-process, pass to software or use for any other purpose; and
      - Is without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access ot the internet
      [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Copyright SPARC

      ## Why Use Open Data?
      Open data is important because it:
      - . When datasets are openly available, they can be easily accessed and used to create a fuller picture of a given area of inquiry, or analyzed by data mining software that can uncover connections not apparent to those who produce the original data.
      - . Researchers estimate that $3.2 trillion in economic output could be added to global GDP through Open Data across all sectors, with scientific and scholarly data playing an important role. [1]
      - . There are a huge number of ways to use or analyze any given dataset. What seems like noise to one person could be an important discovery to someone else with a different perspective or analytical technique.
      - . When the data that underlies findings is accessible, researchers can check each other's work and ensure that conclusions are built upon a firm foundation.
      - From research funders like the US government to publishers, institutions involved in the research process are beginning to require that, at the very least, the data that underlies publications be made openly accessible.

      ## Creating a Codebook
      Codes are collections of references from your data about a specific theme, topic, concept, idea, or experience, and can be descriptive or analytical. You can create codes before you start coding and/or as you code your data.

      ### Creating Codes Before Coding
      - In the Navigation View panel, click on Nodes
      - In the List View panel, right-click and select New Top Level Node
      - Enter a name (required) and a description (optional)
      - OPTIONAL: If you're going to create hierarchical codes with parent and child codes, check the box, Aggregate coding from child nodes, to have NVivo automatically double-code at the parent code when coding child codes
      - OPTIONAL: Use the color drop-down menu to assign colors to your codes
      - Click Done and you'll see the new code added in the List View panel
      - OPTIONAL: To create a child code, right-click on a code you previously created, click New Node, and repeat the process

      ## What is Data Visualization?
      Data visualization is an umbrella term referring to the representation of raw data content in a graphic or pictorial manner. Related concepts include information visualization and scientific visualization. Using visual features of encoded data such as position, size, shape, hue and saturation, motion, etc., data visualization applies tools and techniques to communicate the raw data in visual form.
      Common examples include charts, graphs, timelines, maps, and even tables.
  utter_data_visualization_important:
  - text: |2

      ## Why Visualize Data?
      Raw data and statistics can often appear confusing. Many research data sets are going to be overwhelming in size. Data visualization applies what we know about human perception to optimize cognition, making it easier to understand, interpret, and analyze patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
      Use of effective data visualization if often focused on one of two primary purposes:
      - sometimes referred to as sense-making or data analysis. Using visualization techniques to examine and discover trends, associations, outliers, etc., that may not be obvious when viewing the raw data.
      - also referred to as storytelling or communication. Creating visualizations that make understanding what the data is saying clearer and more obvious.
      Successful data visualization relies on selecting the appropriate tool, technique, and visual expression that most effectively presents the story the data is telling. Data visualization should be considered a means to an end, not an end in itself.

      ## The Data Science Lifecycle
      Data visualization is one component of a much broader data analytics life cycle. While there is some variation in defining the full data analytics life cycle, the graphic below presents a general structure encompassing the basic components.

  - text: |2

      ## Terminology
      When discussing data visualization, various related terms may be used somewhat loosely. The following is a very brief glossary of commonly used data terminology:
      - A process of building, cleaning, and structuring datasets for the purpose of analysis and extraction of meaning.
      - Analysis of data to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights.
      - techniques using geographic, topological,  or geometric properties to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights
      - ...refers to a variety of processes designed to transform raw data into more readily used formats.

      - Adapt the visualization to the strengths of the medium and vice-versa
      - Captions are essential
      - Default settings should not assumed to be optimal
      - Color should be used selectively and effectively
      - Be careful not to inadvertently mislead your audience
      - Simple is good. Avoid Chartjunk.
      - Image is not everything. The goal is effective comprehension and communication, not the most impressive visualization.

      ## What are Data Management Plans?
      Data Management Plans, or DMPs, are documents describing what will happen to data during and after research.  Before writing a DMP, review guidelines for the funding agency you are working with. DMPs often include descriptions of:

      - Roles and Responsibilities
      - Types of Data
      - Data Formats and Metadata
      - Access, Sharing, and Privacy
      - Policies and Provisions for Re-use and Re-Distribution
      - Data Storage and Preservation

      [Checklist for a Data Management Plan, v4.0 from the Digital Curation Center](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf)

      In 2013, the US Office of Science and Technology issued a policy memorandum expanding requirements for planning and sharing of data. Most federal funding research agencies require DMPs as part of the grant application process.

      Even if you don't need to meet funder requirements, data management plans are still valuable. Planning ahead of time for the storage, backup, archiving, and sharing (if applicable) of data will:

      - Save time and effort down the road
      - Enhance the value and usefulness of data long-term
      - Increase research efficiency

  - text: |
      Creating a plan to manage and store your data throughout its lifecycle is a critical component of the research process. Not only does having a data management plan save you time and resources, but is a requirement for grant applications for many major funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). In addition, having a plan to manage your data promotes increased data sharing, transparency, and reproducibility.

  utter_option_available_longterm_archiving:
  - text: |
      The University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data. However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist. If you want or need to share your research data, one of these might be a good fit.
      These repositories are also good places to find datasets for re-use.
      - [ICPSR](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/) â€“ The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Science Research is a data repository providing access to deposited data to member institutions, including USC.
      - [Open ICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/) â€“ Repository provides access to deposited data to everyone.
      - [Re3Data](http://www.re3data.org/) â€“ The Registry of Research Data Repositories is a directory to data repositories across many disciplines. The tool provides links to repositories and includes information about deposit requirements.
      - [NIH-Data Sharing Repositories](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/domain_specific_repositories.html) â€“ List of NIH-supported data repositories that make data accessible for reuse.
        [here](https://nnlm.gov/data/repositories).

        If a disciplinary repository does not exist for your data, consider a repository for general data. The following repositories accept data from all disciplines:
      - [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org/)
      - [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash)
      - [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)

  utter_What_is_metadata:
  - text: |
      Metadata is information about the context, content, quality, provenance, and/or accessibility of a dataset. In order for your data to be accessible to you, your colleagues, and other researchers, it must be properly documented. Put simply, metadata is data about your data.
  utter_metadata_important:
  - text: |
      Data often have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them. Researchers may continue to work on data after funding has ceased, follow-up projects may analyse or add to the data, and data may be re-used by other researchers. Well organised, well documented, preserved and shared data are invaluable to advance scientific inquiry and to increase opportunities for learning and innovation.
      --[Create and Manage Data, the UK Data Archive](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/life-cycle)
  utter_include_metadata:
  - text: |

  utter_consistent_file_naming_strategy:
  - text: |
      Developing and following a consistent file naming strategy can make data easier to find, particularly when large numbers of files exist. Although it's common to think that file names will be remembered in the future, unorganized files and folders can lead to frustration down the road.

      Good file naming allows you to identify the contents of the file from the name. It may be useful to consider including some or all of the following information, as long as it is done consistently.
      - File creator's name/initials
      - Date of creation
      - Version number
      - Project or experiment name or acronym
      - Location/spatial coordinates
      - Type of data
      - Conditions
      - File version number
      - Keep file names as short as possible while including necessary information.
      - Do not use special characters such as #, <, >, $, +, %, *, etc. Different operating systems may interpret these as instructions to perform special tasks.
      - Use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_), full stops (.), or spaces in file names.
      - If you add dates, make sure you use consistent formatting.
      - While underscores are invisible when links are underlined, hyphens can still be seen.
      - For files that might be searched online, some search engines don't recognize underscores and others may downgrade page rankings if underscores are used.

  utter_file_format_use_ensure:
  - text: |
      As anyone with data saved on a floppy disk probably realizes, technology changes constantly and, if not planned for, hardware and software obsolescence can render data inaccessible and unreadable. To ensure long-term accessibility of research data, researchers should consider using file formats that share these characteristics:
      - Non-proprietary
      - Open, documented standard
      - Common usage by research community
      - Standard representation ([ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com/),[Unicode](http://unicode.org/))
      - Unencrypted
      - Uncompressed

      Data saved in proprietary formats are vulnerable to obsolescence. Here are examples of open file formats you can use to increase the likelihood that research data will be accessible in the future. A number of applications have been developed to open these types of files:
      - instead of a Microsoft Word extension (.doc, .docx)
      - instead of a Microsoft Excel extension (.xls, .xlsx)
      - TIFF or[JPEG2000](https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/)instead of .gif or .jpg

  utter_backing_data_important:
  - text: |
      Backing up data is an essential part of the data management process. Hardware failure, virus infection, hacking, and loss or theft of hardware are all common realities that can have a devastating effect on research if proper back-up hasn't taken place. See the [UK Data Archive's guidelines on Backing-up Data](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/store.aspx) for more information.

      Back-up and storage are related concepts, but are not the same thing. While storage refers to ways of preserving files for the short- or long-term, back-up refers to preserving copies of your files in different physical locations and using different media to protect against data loss.
  utter_good_rule_thumb_backing:
  - text: |
      A good rule of thumb for backing up data is the 3-2-1 rule. It states that at least 3 total copies of data should exist, 2 of which are local but on different media (devices), and at least 1 copy should be stored offsite. The offsite storage is important in case of fires, floods, or theft.

      ## What is Machine Learning?
      A machine is said to be if its performance or efficiency for a given task improves with the experience (past data). Machine Learning uses advanced algorithms to analyze and learn relationships between the data to make intelligent decisions on what it has learned. The algorithms use a large amount of data to find the relationship. This relationship is called a which is used to make useful predictions or generate content from the data.
      For example, we need physics-based mathematical equations of Earth's atmosphere to predict rainfall using traditional methods. Solving these complex equations requires massive computing resources and time, making the prediction task difficult. With the ML approach, we could provide enormous data to an ML model until the ML model eventually  the mathematical relationship between weather factors producing varying quantities of rain. If we give this model the current weather data, it would predict the amount of rain in the future.

      AI system: Recommend songs to EVERYONE based on number of copies sold, top 10 in Billboard list, Grammy award winners, etc.
      ML system: Recommend songs to each INDIVIDUAL based on previous songs played, other people with similar playlist, choice of singer, genre, etc.
      When using Machine Learning, Neural Networks, or Deep Learning, it is important to know the meaning of the following terms:
      - Refers to a specific problem or objective that the algorithm is designed to solve.
      - Set of rules that a machine follows to achieve a particular goal or the steps needed to get from the inputs to the output.
      - Observed/measured properties or characteristics of the data that are used as input to create a model.
      - : Variable whose value isorby the features; used in supervised learning.
      - It is theorof the target variable. If only 2 labels (such as 0 or 1, yes/no, hot/warm/cold).
      - Subset of data on which the model is initially trained.
      - Subset of data (distinct from training) that is used by the model to predict output and validate the model.
      - Subset of data (different from training and validation) on which model is tested.

  - text: |
      ## What are the different types of Machine Learning?
      There are 4 major types of ML problems:
      - Used for tasks where the target variable has defined labels or values.The target variable has 2 labels (binary class classification) or more (multiclass classification). For example:Whether USA will win or lose a match (binary).Gmail classifying email in classes like social, promotion, updates, or spam (multiclass).The output is numeric and has a continuous value and the task is to predict a value as closer to the actual output value. For example predict stock price of a stock.
      - Used for tasks where the target variable or output has no defined labels and hidden patterns in the data are discovered without human intervention.Discovering the inherent groupings in the data such as grouping customers by their purchasing behavior.Discover rules that describe large portions of the data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y
      - This is a hybrid technique between supervised and unsupervised learning, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data.
      - Learning happens by taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path to take in a specific situation. If there is no training data, it is bound to learn from its experience. Reward is defined by the experts.
      Figure (2) gives the example of  supervised and unsupervised Learning.

      ## AI Use in Developing Manuscripts
      Many journals and publishers have developed or are considering policies surrounding the use of AI in developing or authoring manuscripts. You can generally find this information in the Instructions for Authors (or similar) section of the journal. These policies and guidelines are rapidly evolving, so be sure to check regularly for updates.
      While journal or publisher policies will always be your final determinant for whether or how you can use AI in developing your manuscript, a few best practices include:
      - Be transparent. Disclose and describe the use of AI in developing or author your manuscript.
      - Cite your use of the AI tool.
      - Be aware that AI can produce incorrect information and generate false citations. Carefully check the accuracy of content generated by the AI tool.

      ## When and Why to Cite
      ### Citation Basics
      When you directly quote, paraphrase, or reference another source that has influenced your own work, you need to provide a proper citation. You should also provide documentation for any statistics or facts that are not considered common knowledge.
      - Avoid charges of plagiarism
      - Give credit to the original author or creator
      - Provide context for your audience
      - Allow readers to find and consult the source themselves

      ## Generative AI Image/Art generators
      ### How do AI art generators work?
      The goal of an AI art generator is to take a text prompt and turn it into an image that represents the prompt. Comparable to LLMs (large language models), art generators use vast image-text pair content models to discern and learn image meanings and characteristics. Ultimately, they render a resulting image using either a diffusion model or generative adversarial networks (GANS).
      Unlike the major generative AI chatbots, most generative AI art generators have limited or no free access.

      ## What is It?
      Text mining is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets. It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.   It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.  This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.  It can be called Distant Reading, but you should also do a close reading on a portion of the texts so that you are well informed on the content you are researching.

      ## Create and Manage Open Access Journals
      The University of South Carolina Libraries offers software and support for the creation and management of open access journals. The library uses [Digital Commons software to host journals](https://www.bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/managing-publishing-journals/). Benefits of using this software include support for all types of content, search engine optimization, access to detailed analytics, and flexible peer-review workflows.
      USC affiliated faculty are eligible for free journal hosting and support. Before launching a new journal, youâ€™ll need to carefully consider the details of your journal, including people, policies, content, production, design, workflow, and sustainability. In most cases, you'll be asked to sign a memorandum of understanding with the University Libraries to delineate expectations and responsibilities.

      - Is this title already in use? Check [WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/) and [Ulrichsweb](https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://www.ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com) to confirm that the title is available. Make sure that the title is clear and can be abbreviated.
      - The library will provide a consultation to help you create a landing page for the journal. You will need to provide a color scheme and a banner or cover photo. You should also consider if you will need to create issue covers and images within the journal. You may wish to consult other [journals published through Digital Commons](https://www.bepress.com/categories_jnl/all-journals/) as examples of what is possible.
      - What subject areas and topics will the journal cover? What is the purpose of the journal? Are there existing journals with similar content? If so, what will make this journal unique? Who is the intended audience of this journal?
      - What types of materials will be accepted? Only research articles, or will you allow reviews, opinion pieces, videos, etc.? How will you solicit quality content over an extended period of time?
      - How often will issues/articles be published? Will articles be published as received or bundled as issues?
      - Will you [assign DOIs](https://www.doi.org/) to content? Digital Commons does not automatically assign DOIs, but USC Libraries is a [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) member and can work with you to incorporate a DOI assignment workflow. The Libraries will be responsible for the cost of registering current content. If you would like to assign DOIs to backfiles, you will be responsible for the cost.
      - Journal indexing will make your journal and its content more discoverable. All new journals are required to obtain an ISSN. Once you have an ISSN, register with [Ulrich's Periodical Directory](https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://www.ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com) by emailing [ulrichs@proquest.com](mailto:ulrichs@proquest.com). In the email, include the journal name, publisher name (University of South Carolina Libraries), and any other relevant details. Read the [FAQs](http://www.ulrichsweb.com/ulrichsweb/faqs.asp) for more details. If your journal meets the [criteria](https://doaj.org/publishers#applying), register it with the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/application/new). Check [Google Scholar ](https://scholar.google.com/) to see if your journal appears. If it does not, [register it](http://www.google.com/support/scholar/bin/request.py). There will be additional indexing opportunities dependent on your discipline. You will likely be familiar with the databases used heavily in your field. Each will have different policies and procedures that are typically available from their website.
      - What is your expected timeline? Plan on allowing one or two years of preparation time for the first journal issue to be released. When would you like to issue the first call for papers? What is your target date for the first issue?

      ## Managing Open Access Journals
      ## People
      - Who will serve as journal manager, the person who is primarily responsible for this journal during the planning stages and after the journal has launched?You will likely need a managing editor to create and publish journal issues, monitor submissions, and assign peer-reviewers. You may  need section editors to manage specific articles. Additionally, you will need production staff who handle tasks such as copyediting, layout, and proofing. You'll also likely need an editorial board, authors, and reviewers.While there certainly can be overlap in these roles (for example, you may choose to ask your editorial board to act as reviewers or content shepherds) and you don't necessarily need to have names in place to start the journal creation process, keep in mind tht these roles will continue to be necessary throughout the life of the journal. You should have an idea of how you will recruit participants.We recommend that you establish documentation detailing responsibilities and terms for each of these roles.

      - How will you recruit and train new board members and staff? How often will turnover take place? Do you have an idea of how long you will retain primary responsibility for the journal and who will replace you if you can no longer act as the journal manager?

  utter_policy_established_open_access:
  - text: |
      ## Policies
      - How will submitted manuscripts be considered for inclusion? How will manuscripts be checked for plagiarism and/or copyright violations?

      - What kind of review will each submission require? Describe the procedure in detail, including the peer review process and reviewer guidelines if applicable. Digital Commons includes[workflow procedures for peer review](https://www.bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/3150/), but you should have an idea of what type of peer review is appropriate for your journal.Who will be involved in the peer review process?

      - All journals will be available open access immediately upon publication if hosted through the University of South Carolina Libraries. The open access policy should be clearly stated on the journal's webpage and on author submission agreements.

      - Who will hold the copyright for submissions? Many open access journals release content under a Creative Commons license.[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)has a selection tool for picking an appropriate license.Develop preliminary public statements for copyright policies, including rights, usage, attribution, and exceptions. You may wish to consult other journals in your field or[published through Digital Commons](https://www.bepress.com/categories_jnl/all-journals/)as examples.In the event of a copyright infringement claim or other legal challenge, USC Libraries may require the journal to remove the offending content from the journal.

  utter_consider_planning_digital_scholarship:
  - text: |
      ## Plan your Project
      Creating digital scholarship can take years of research, planning, and coordination, which is why it's important to create a project plan and timeline as early as possible. While your plan may evolve and need to be updated over time, it's a good idea to use it as a guide to stay organized. Here are some factors to consider:
      - What is the primary purpose of your project? Think of a way to describe your project in two or three sentences. This abstract can be used to pitch to funders or to communicate with your intended audience and peers.

      - Who will the audience be for your project? In most cases, it's available on the web, it will be available to anyone, but who would be most interested in your site? Consider how others might use or reuse your content.

      - Digital scholarship projects often, but not always, involve collaboration. Will you need to work with others, and if so, what roles will they play?

      - What content management system (CMS) or platform would be the most effective for hosting your project? Do you already know how to use the CMS, or do you need training or assistance? Are there any preliminary or ongoing costs associated with your CMS of choice? For more information on choosing a CMS and the options available to you, visit[Content Management Systems.](https://sc.libapps.com/libguides/admin_c.php?g=943207&p=6798782)

      - What types of digital tools will you need beyond the CMS? If you plan to incorporate visualizations, annotations, maps, timelines, databases, or other types of digital content, you will need to be able to select and use these tools. Learn more from[Digital Tools](https://guides.library.sc.edu/digitalscholarship/tools).

      - Where will you store your master files and data? Many CMS have limited storage space available. The Libraries may offer storage options for different uses. Your University affiliation may effect your storage options, so consider if you will continue to need to host the content over a short time period or many years.

      - Good metadata, or information describing the various aspects of your project, is essential for helping users locate and access your project. How will you describe the files, pages, and other content included on your website? Some platforms, like Omeka, make it easy to incorporate metadata throughout your project.

      - You'll need to consider both your copyrights and the copyrights of others as you develop your product. Just because you've published your materials on the web doesn't mean that they aren't copyrighted. Consider[assigning a Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)to your works to grant users specific permissions for using your works. You'll also want to carefully consider if and how you reuse the copyrighted works, including text, videos, images, etc., of others.[Learn more about copyright, permissions, and licensing](https://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright). If there are privacy concerns, make sure they are addressed before publishing content.

      - Your project isn't finished once it's available online. Your website will need to be maintained and updated regularly. If your hosting service relies on funds or institutional credentials, consider how you might maintain access after your initial funding expires or if you leave your institution. If you remove the website, consider archiving your site for your own or external purposes. Explore our[Web Archiving](https://sc.libapps.com/libguides/admin_c.php?g=943207&p=6798779)page for more information.

      - Consider how you will promote and share your project. You may want to share your project through relevant teaching and scholarship Listservs, a[scholarship](http://guides.library.sc.edu/openaccessresources/repositories)or[teaching](http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/createOER)repository, or through social media.

      - Are there funding opportunities available to support your project? Many organizations offer grants and other forms of funding for digital scholarship projects. [Learn more about funding opportunities](https://neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants).

      [Visualizing Objects, Places, and Spaces: A Digital Project Handbook](https://handbook.pubpub.org/) is a great resource for those interested in creating a digital project. It offers thorough, practical guidance from planning through implementation.

  - text: |
      ## Copyright Basics
      Information and educational tools on this website are offered to assist faculty, staff, and students of the University in making good decisions about the appropriate use of copyrighted materials.

      The Copyright Law (Title 17 of the US Code) exists to grant certain rights to content creators. It allows them the control over copies, derivative works, public display, public performance, and transmission of their works. Copyright law attempts to balance the need to establish incentive for content creators to profit from their work, and thus have incentive to continue to create, with the additional need for society to have some rights to these works such as the right to criticize, parody, and use for education.  Although we do, as educators, have specific exceptions granted to us through this law, we still have obligations to meet so that we ensure that the rights of those who created the content are protected.

      Copyright covers any original work put in a tangible medium. This includes digital works (webpages, graphics, email, etc.), photographs, and computer software. It does not cover works of expression that are not in a tangible form (i.e. ideas, names, titles, concepts, or improvised performances that aren't recorded) and works in the public domain.

  - text: |
      ## Making Copyright Decisions
        Is the work covered by copyright or could it be part of the [Public Domain](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/publicdomain)? 
      Ideas, facts, processes, and concepts cannot be copyrighted.  Works must meet a minimal level of originality to be able to be copyrighted.  Many works are in the public domain, which means they are free to be used by all.  [Learn more about the public domain.](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3629780)
            Is there an [Exception](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/exceptions) that allows me to use this work?
      Take a look at the [special exceptions](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3629781) written into the copyright law by congress to help support teaching and scholarship.  These exceptions may make your use of copyrighted material legal.
            Is the work covered by a [License](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/licensing) that would allow you to use it? 
      [Find out more](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/licensing) about the creative commons, databases the library purchases for your use, as well as your obligations to uphold licenses.
              Could the use be a [Fair Use](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/fairuse)? 
      [Find out more](http://guides.library.sc.edu/aecontent.php?pid=441641&sid=3630697) about this important doctrine written into the copyright law to allow society certain rights to use copyrighted materials.
              How can you obtain [Permission](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/permission) to use a protected work? 
      If the work is protected by copyright and your use of the work is not covered by an exception, you can ask the copyright holder for permission to use the work. [Find more information](http://guides.library.sc.edu/copyright/permission) about seeking permission to use copyrighted material.

      ## Types of Repositories
      Sharing your previously published research can[ increase its visibility and reach](https://sparceurope.org/what-we-do/open-access/sparc-europe-open-access-resources/open-access-citation-advantage-service-oaca/oaca-list/). It's important to understand the differences in the types of repositories to determine which is most appropriate for sharing your work. While there is some overlap between repository types, the three main types are:

      Institutional repositories (IRs) are repositories that are hosted and managed by educational institutions. They exist to preserve and share the scholarly output of an educational institution. [Scholar Commons](http://scholarcommons.sc.edu) is the institutional repository of the University of South Carolina. It can be accessed from [http://scholarcommons.sc.edu](http://scholarcommons.sc.edu). 

      Disciplinary repositories, sometimes known as subject repositories, are digital archives for subject-specific scholarly output. Some scholars choose to share their works through disciplinary repositories to increase the visibility of their work among subject experts and possible collaborators. Some disciplinary repositories rely on author generated content, while use web crawlers to locate and download publicly available content for inclusion. To find a disciplinary repository to share your work, visit the [Disciplinary Repositories Wiki](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Disciplinary_repositories) for a comprehensive list organized by subject.

      Multidisciplinary repositories archive and make available works across multiple disciplines.

  utter_version_work_share:
  - text: |
      ## What Can I Share?
      It can be tricky to know which version of your work you can share. It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works. But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which? Visit the [Which Version Can I Share? ](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/sharing)page for an overview of pre-prints, post-prints, publisher PDFs and for information on how to locate these records. Sharing the legally-allowed version of your research protects your works from being taken down.

      ## Social Networking
      Social networking sites for academics, such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate, are used by some researchers to share their scholarly works and monitor analytics across disciplines. These sites are often used as social media and outreach tools. Because these types of sites have been regularly accused by publishers of [massive copyright infringement](http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/), it's important that researchers pay close attention to the terms of service and privacy policies of these sites.
      The University of California Office of Scholarly Communication provides a [great read on the differences between academic social networking sites and open access repositories](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2015/12/a-social-networking-site-is-not-an-open-access-repository/?utm_source=hootsuite).

      Creating an OER is similar to authoring any other document, except that you are assigning that content an open license which usually allows for its free use and re-purposing by others. 
      Things to consider:
      - What license will you assign to your OER? Using a[Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)will provide you with the legal framework to share your OER.
      - How will you make your OER accessible to all students? We recommend the[Open Education Consortium's guide](http://www.oeconsortium.org/resources/toolkits/accessibility/)to addressing accessibility issues.
      - Where will you create and host your OER? There are sites available from which you can directly upload and share your materials, and there are educational repositories designed specifically to assist with the creation and hosting of OER. For more information on creating and hosting OER, visit the section titled[Sites for creating and hosting OER](http://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=410356&p=3732812#s-lg-box-wrapper-13612726).
      - How will you share your OER? Once you've created your OER, you may want to share it across many directories and repositories for maximum visibility. Consider submitting your work to[MERLOT](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm),[OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/), or the[Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/).

      ## Modifying OER
      Modifying an existing OER is a a simpler way of adopting content to suit your needs than creating a new OER. Before modifying an OER, check that the Creative Commons license does not contain a no derivatives clause. If it does, you do not have permission to modify the work. Search for formats that are conducive to modification, such as .docx and .rtf. Once you've downloaded and modified the OER, you can upload it to many of the sites listed in the [Sites for Creating and Hosting OER](http://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=410356&p=3732812#s-lg-box-wrapper-13612726) section.

  - text: |
      ## What Can Be Copyrighted?
      Not everything created can be copyrighted. One important aspect of copyright law throughout history is that ideas and facts cannot be copyrighted.  For example, you may write a book about capitalism. The words you use to express your idea may be copyrighted; however, you cannot own the idea of capitalism. Ideas belong to our culture.
      There is a minimal standard of originality that must be met for works to be protected by copyright. For example, if you were to take a picture of the Mona Lisa, it is a replication of the original. You cannot copyright that picture because it adds nothing original. However, if you were to add to the photo by changing the colors or other artistic elements, you might be able to copyright that image. Lists that lack originality, such as the white pages of a phone book, typically cannot be copyrighted because they do not meet the standard of minimal original content.
      Also, facts and processes cannot be copyrighted. For example, a recipe for cheesecake with a list of ingredients, and instructions on how to bake the cake is not copyrightable. However, if you were to include stories of the person who created the recipe, or suggestions for ways to serve it, then that content would be copyrightable.

  utter_public_domain:
  - text: |
      ## What is the Public Domain?
      A work in the public domain is not protected by copyright. The public domain is important to us as a culture. Allowing people to create using other people's ideas and works helps us remain an innovative and progressive society. Many important works are in the public domain. Some include:
      - works published before 1927
      - works where copyright has expired
      - most federal documents
      - facts, titles, ideas, etc.
      What is actually in the public domain can be very complicated at times, and it's difficult in some circumstances to find a copyright owner resulting in an orphaned work. Cornell has an excellent chart that details many other circumstances where things fall under the public domain:

  utter_statutory_exemption_copyright:
  - text: |
      ## Statutory Exemptions
      ##### Library Copying (Section 108)
      Most academic and public libraries can benefit from this provision that permits libraries to make copies of materials for preservation and security, to give copies to users for their private study or research, and to send copies through interlibrary loan. Like most of the statutes, it applies only to certain types of works, and only under certain circumstances.

      ##### First Sale (Section 109(a))
      This important exception limits the distribution rights of the copyright holder by providing that once the owner authorizes the release of lawfully made copies of a work, those copies may in turn be passed along to others by sale, rental, loan, gift, or other transfer. This important exception allows libraries to lend materials and stores to sell books. The Supreme Court addressed this exception in the [Kirtsaeng](http://copyright.columbia.edu/copyright/2013/03/20/the-kirtsaeng-decision-copyright-logic-and-libraries/) decision, holding that the â€˜first saleâ€™ doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad.

      ##### Public Displays (Section 109(c))
      One of the rights of copyright owners is the right to make public displays, but this statute allows the owner of a lawfully made copy of a work to display it to the public at the place where the work is located. The art museum that owns a painting may hang it on the wall; a bookstore can place books on display in front windows; and the library may put materials in the display cases for all to see.

      ##### Displays and Performances in Face-to-Face Teaching (Section 110(1))
      Under this exception, educators may make performances and displays of all types of works in a classroom or similar place at most educational institutions. It allows instructors and students to recite poetry, read plays, show videos, play music, project slides, and engage in many other performances and displays of protected works in the classroom setting. This statute is actually comparatively simple and broad, but keep in mind that it permits only displays and performances in the classroomâ€”not the making of copies or the posting of digital works on servers.

      ##### Computer Software (Section 117)
      This exception allows the owner of a copy of a computer program to modify the program to work on his or her computer or computer platform, and to make a back-up copy of the software to use in the event of damage to or destruction of the original copy. Realistically, most commercial programs are sold for use on multiple platforms, or the rights of use may be governed by license agreements.

      ##### Architectural Works (Section 120)
      Architectural designs are protected by copyright, but this exception makes clear that, once a building is constructed at a place visible to the public, anyone may make and use a picture of that building without infringing the copyright in the architectural design. We might infringe copyright when we reproduce blueprints or duplicate the Trump Tower, but we are not infringing when we snap a photograph and use it in a book or even on postcards.

      ##### Special Formats for Persons Who Are Blind or Have Other Disabilities (Section 121)
      This exception permits certain organizations to make specific types of formats of published, non-dramatic literary works in order that they may be useful to persons who are blind or have other disabilities. For example, some educational institutions and libraries may be able to make large-print or Braille versions of some works in the collection.

  - text: |
      ## Fair Use Basics
      One of the limitations on copyright is the Fair Use doctrine, which can be found in [section 107 of the copyright law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107). This broad and flexible doctrine provides instances for when using copyrighted material may be deemed fair. Each of the four factors must be weighed in determining if fair use applies:
      - The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
      - The nature of the copyrighted work
      - The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
      - The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.
      Another important consideration is if your use may be transformative. In other words, is your use of the work substantially different from the original intention of the work?

      ## Evaluation Methods
      Peer evaluation is an important part of scholarly publication. But how should nontraditional scholarly output be evaluated? In this section, we'll provide brief suggestions for evaluating digital scholarship and a curated list of peer-reviewed journals that review and publish on digital scholarship or digital humanities projects.
      - Scholarship: Is the project intellectually rigorous? Is the methodology sound? Are arguments properly developed?

      - Technology: Is the technical design sound? Does it make use of appropriate digital tools, or create robust technologies for use in the field? Is the site interoperable? Does it use appropriate web standards?

      - Audience: Does the project effectively engage academic and public audiences?

      - Editorial quality: Are appropriate editorial standards, such as TEI, used? Is the site clear and free from grammatical or spelling issues? Is the site accessible? Is a metadata schema used consistently?

      - Sustainability: Does the project address digital preservation?
      Vol. 1, No. 4 of the Journal of Digital Humanities presents a number of comprehensive approaches for evaluating digital scholarship. This issue should be consulted to gain a better understanding of the complexities and considerations of evaluating digital scholarship.

      ## OER Impact
      The use of Open Educational Resources (OER) can benefit students and instructors. Research has shown that:
      - [The use of OER can save students money without negatively impacting learning outcomes.](https://openpraxis.org/index.php/OpenPraxis/article/view/505)
      - [OER adoption improves end-of-course grades and decreases course withdrawals and the grades of D and F (DFW grades). ](http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE3386.pdf)
      At the University of South Carolina, the use of OER and other freely-available materials has saved students over $3,000,000 since 2015.

      ## Determining if a Journal is Predatory
      - Closely examine the editor and staff of the journal. Is a single editor responsible for a large number of journals across a publisher? Is there a lack of information or diversity on the editorial or review board?
      - Does the publisher fail to list transparent policies and fees? Did the publisher's operations begin with a large fleet of quickly created journals?
      - Is the contact information for the publisher, editors, or review board difficult to find or not present?
      - Is the journal title misleading, or does it list a false impact factor or other quality-determining metrics?
      - Does the journal send spam requests for manuscripts or peer reviews to scholars not qualified to write on or review the subject in question?
      - Are previously published articles low quality or re-published without proper permissions from other journals?

      ## Making Your Class Affordable
      Many faculty members across USC have converted traditional courses to zero cost courses. How can you do the same? There's no one answer for everyone, but you can use a mix of Open Educational Resources, library-licensed resources, and items freely available or in the public domain on the web. Don't get discouraged if you do not immediately see an open textbook that fits your needs. A librarian can help you locate alternate resources to make your class affordable.

      ## Using OER
      Using Open Educational Resources (OER) is one way to make your class affordable. Most OER are funded by governments, foundation grants, or universities and are created, edited, and peer-reviewed by academics, ensuring that their quality is comparable to traditional textbooks. While many OER are created for lower level, high-enrollment courses, more are being developed for higher-level specialized courses. To locate OER to use in your classes, visit [http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks](http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks).

      ## Using Library-Licensed Resources
      While library-licensed resources are not OER and may come with copyright and licensing restrictions, using materials available through your library can save your students money. The library offers e-books, databases, and other digital resources that can be accessed through Blackboard or your syllabus.

      ## Faculty in Arts and Sciences, Education Honored with 2024 SCoer Awards
      Posted on: June 14, 2024; Updated on: June 14, 2024
      By Leslie Haynsworth, [haynswor@mailbox.sc.edu](mailto:haynswor@mailbox.sc.edu)
      The SCoer Awards recognize and support faculty who use open educational resources in their classrooms. To date, USC faculty who have worked with the Libraries to adopt affordable learning materials have saved students more than $3 million in textbook costs.

      Given annually by University Libraries, the SCoer Awards recognize faculty who use open educational resources in their classrooms.

      To participate in the program, Track One honorees attend a workshop hosted by University Libraries to help them identify or create OER materials for their courses. They commit to switching from the use of a traditional textbook to an OER or library-based resource in one of their classes and are recognized with a certificate and a $1,000 award.
      Track Two honorees are recognized for their existing use of OER materials and agree to serve as affordable learning advocates and to create resources for other instructors interested in transitioning to the use of affordable learning materials.
      Award recipients are selected by USC Student Government representatives and University Libraries staff.

      Meet this yearâ€™s winners:
      I wrote a free textbook for upper-level robotics courses, but do not have experience identifying, selecting, and utilizing OER created by others, especially for lower-level courses like my UNIX/Linux Fundamentals course. The subject of this course is one that lends itself well to OER, compared to other aspects of computer science, because there is a long history and plenty of free materials. Students have told me that the current traditional textbooks are not helpful, so I suspect that an OER format may both improve learning outcomes and reduce the costs for students.
      After years of teaching at UofSC, I can clearly identify the potential benefits of using affordable and accessible resources into my own classes. It seems to me that participating in this award program may greatly help me with this transition.
      As a first-generation college student myself, I remember the struggle of having to decide between meals or textbooks. I remember the high cost of education being compounded by high textbook costs that seemed to provide just another barrier against an equitable educational experience. Now, as a faculty member at UofSC, I am focused on creating an equitable, anti-racist class for our students, and one of the direct ways I can take action is by offering a zero-cost course, in terms of needed materials. The pandemic has also brought to light the inequities in our community and in higher education. Equity is a concept that means a lot to me, and the more barriers I can help dismantle for the continued and augmented success of our students, the better, and this program will allow me the resources needed to do just that.
      I am participating in this award program in order to enhance the overall course delivery modalities, engage students in meaningful learning, and cultivate a desire for students to embrace lifelong learning. I believe using innovative and intriguing strategies will better equip my students for success after college and allow them the opportunity to recognize that there are many ways to continue to grow and learn.

      The winners are , Department of Biological Sciences, , Department of Psychology, Department of Psychology, and , Department of Languages, Literature and Culture.

      Meet this yearâ€™s winners:
      ### Gerald Brasington
      I am a first-generation college and first-generation medical school graduate. Purchasing extremely expensive books caused financial hardship for me and my parents. I have dedicated my career to making materials low-cost or free so today's students will not face the same hardships as I did. Education is a gift, and I want to give that gift to my students without the fear or worry about affording the necessary materials.
      ### Amanda Fairchild
      I am strongly invested in reducing course material costs. In my own studies, I always appreciated when professors offered a course pack or other material in lieu of a textbook. I would like to be able to provide a similar opportunity for my own students.
      My colleague, Dr. Dexin Shi, and I both teach PSYC 227 and use the same textbook intentionally. We actively collaborate to coordinate course content to positively impact our students and improve our materials. I seek to collaborate with Dexin with this new open resource experience, so we can continue to optimize and streamline our course while reducing the costs students incur.
      ### Dexin Shi
      As a college professor, I understand that textbooks can be expensive for students. Actually, price is one important factor for me when selecting textbooks for my classes. For example, I teach introduction to Statistics to psychology majors, and many textbooks cost over $100, and some even over $200. The cost of textbooks can be a burden for many students, given the number of classes they take. I am glad to learn about this award opportunity to develop a zero-cost course. I believe that free access to course materials could enhance the learning opportunities and outcome for my students.
      ### Ashley Williard
      Especially during the COVID-19 crisis, it is crucial to democratize courses by making content affordable and accessible. Language textbooks are expensive, and it can be challenging to get French books shipped from abroad. Students already face enormous pressure from high tuition and an uncertain economy. By taking the expense of course materials out of the picture, all students can instead focus on content from day one of the semester, regardless of their financial situation. Providing equal access ensures a more fair, diverse and rich learning environment.

      ### Meredith DeBoom
      I am a first-generation college graduate ... When I began my career as an Assistant Professor at USC in Fall 2018, I made a commitment to myself that improving the inclusivity of higher education would be a priority in my career. Rather than walking away with an expensive textbook, I would much rather my students leave with a clear understanding of how they can apply geographic tools and theories in their careers.
      ### Austin Downey
      I want to use this program to help me to develop Open Educational Resources (OER) (textbook, code, and YouTube Videos) and a no-cost Mechanical Vibrations (EMCH 330) course that will be free of any copyright issues or software costs, allowing it to be freely shared.
      ### Jennifer Pournelle
      As a primary instructor for a Carolina Core science course open to all non-science majors, I have the privilege of working with a huge share of students unfamiliar with, and often terrified by, science terms and practices they view as mystifying and inapplicable.
      ### Timothy Shaw
      I have gotten permission to teach from the OpenStax text on a trial basis this fall and develop a slide set for later adoption in more sections based on the OER commons resources.

      The text is written in lucid, accessible prose, and provides adequate context for any jargon/technical terminology used.
      Consistency
      The text is internally consistent in terms of terminology and framework.
      Modularity
      The text is easily and readily divisible into smaller reading sections that can be assigned at different points within the course (i.e., enormous blocks of text without subheadings should be avoided). The text should not be overly self-referential, and should be easily reorganized and realigned with various subunits of a course without presenting much disruption to the reader.
      Organization/Structure/Flow
      The topics in the text are presented in a logical, clear fashion.
      Interface
      The text is free of significant interface issues, including navigation problems, distortion of images/charts, and any other display features that may distract or confuse the reader.
      Grammatical Errors
      The text contains no grammatical errors.
      Cultural Relevance
      The text is not culturally insensitive or offensive in any way. It should make use of examples that are inclusive of a variety of races, ethnicities, and backgrounds.

      Open pedagogy is the practice of involving students in the creation of scholarship. It's a way to help students contribute to knowledge rather than simply consuming it. Considered a form of experiential learning, open pedagogy allows students to learn through practice and experiment with their own creativity and direction.

      There are many ways to involve students in the creation of knowledge. Some professors allow students to perform research and then [correct or contribute to a Wikipedia page](https://wikiedu.org/changing/students/). Others ask students to [create blogs or websites ](https://thechcexplored.wordpress.com/blog/)detailing their learning and experiences. Some simply ask students to learn about a topic and then create problems for other students to solve. There are professors who allow students to [annotate and discuss readings ](https://web.hypothes.is/education/)with each other and even those outside of the class visibly on the web. Other instructors facilitate open chats with students, authors, and experts through Twitter. Some students even produce [open, online textbooks](https://openeal.pressbooks.com/) that can be used by the larger education community.
