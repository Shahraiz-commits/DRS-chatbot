Your data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.  In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text. PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.  Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.  TXT , TSV, or CSV are the best formats for working with data.
If your computer can no longer handle the size of the data set, contact DoIT [Research Computing ](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rc/index.php)about their high performance computing (HPC) options.

Your data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.  In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text. PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.  Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.  TXT , TSV, or CSV are the best formats for working with data.
If your computer can no longer handle the size of the data set, contact DoIT [Research Computing ](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rc/index.php)about their high performance computing (HPC) options.

Your data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.  In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text. PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.  Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.  TXT , TSV, or CSV are the best formats for working with data.
If your computer can no longer handle the size of the data set, contact DoIT [Research Computing ](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rc/index.php)about their high performance computing (HPC) options.

 is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets. It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.   It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.  This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.  It can be called Distant Reading, but you should also do a close reading on a portion of the texts so that you are well informed on the content you are researching.

 is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets. It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.   It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.  This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.  It can be called Distant Reading, but you should also do a close reading on a portion of the texts so that you are well informed on the content you are researching.

Selecting the appropriate data visualization tool can be challenging, given the many available options. You will want to consider: 
- Your data : the type and amount will affect the success of the tool you use. Numerical, geospatial, or textual data may benefit from use of different tools.
- Ease of use : based on your level of knowledge, desire to learn, and availability of time, you may find one tool more appropriate than another.
- Tool features : each visualization tool will vary in what features they provide, how easy those features are to use, and how effective they are. Choose the tool that offers the best outcome for your particular project.
- Cost : Some tools are free while others have associated costs. Some free versions have limitations that might impact your project.

Selecting the appropriate data visualization tool can be challenging, given the many available options. You will want to consider: 
- Your data : the type and amount will affect the success of the tool you use. Numerical, geospatial, or textual data may benefit from use of different tools.
- Ease of use : based on your level of knowledge, desire to learn, and availability of time, you may find one tool more appropriate than another.
- Tool features : each visualization tool will vary in what features they provide, how easy those features are to use, and how effective they are. Choose the tool that offers the best outcome for your particular project.
- Cost : Some tools are free while others have associated costs. Some free versions have limitations that might impact your project.

Selecting the appropriate data visualization tool can be challenging, given the many available options. You will want to consider: 
- Your data : the type and amount will affect the success of the tool you use. Numerical, geospatial, or textual data may benefit from use of different tools.
- Ease of use : based on your level of knowledge, desire to learn, and availability of time, you may find one tool more appropriate than another.
- Tool features : each visualization tool will vary in what features they provide, how easy those features are to use, and how effective they are. Choose the tool that offers the best outcome for your particular project.
- Cost : Some tools are free while others have associated costs. Some free versions have limitations that might impact your project.

The University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data.
However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist.
If you want or need to share your research data, one of these might be a good fit.
These repositories are also good places to find datasets for re-use.

The University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data.
However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist.
If you want or need to share your research data, one of these might be a good fit.
These repositories are also good places to find datasets for re-use.

Social networking sites for academics, such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate, are used by some researchers to share their scholarly works and monitor analytics across disciplines.
These sites are often used as social media and outreach tools.
Because these types of sites have been regularly accused by publishers of [massive copyright infringement](http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/), it's important that researchers pay close attention to the terms of service and privacy policies of these sites.

Social networking sites for academics, such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate, are used by some researchers to share their scholarly works and monitor analytics across disciplines.
These sites are often used as social media and outreach tools.
Because these types of sites have been regularly accused by publishers of [massive copyright infringement](http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/), it's important that researchers pay close attention to the terms of service and privacy policies of these sites.
The University of California Office of Scholarly Communication provides a [great read on the differences between academic social networking sites and open access repositories](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2015/12/a-social-networking-site-is-not-an-open-access-repository/?utm_source=hootsuite).

Social networking sites for academics, such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate, are used by some researchers to share their scholarly works and monitor analytics across disciplines.
These sites are often used as social media and outreach tools.
Because these types of sites have been regularly accused by publishers of [massive copyright infringement](http://www.responsiblesharing.org/coalition-statement/), it's important that researchers pay close attention to the terms of service and privacy policies of these sites.
The University of California Office of Scholarly Communication provides a [great read on the differences between academic social networking sites and open access repositories](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2015/12/a-social-networking-site-is-not-an-open-access-repository/?utm_source=hootsuite).

Your data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.
In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text.
PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.
Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.

The University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data.
However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist.
If you want or need to share your research data, one of these might be a good fit.
These repositories are also good places to find datasets for re-use.

Text analysis is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets.
It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.
It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.
This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.

##### Getting Started with text analysis
- What is your research question?
- Pull together a team of support: librarians, computer programmers, statisticians are on campus and here to help.

Your data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.
In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text.
PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.
Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.

The University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data.
However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist.
If you want or need to share your research data, one of these might be a good fit.
These repositories are also good places to find datasets for re-use.

Text analysis is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets.
It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.
It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.
This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.

##### Getting Started with text analysis
- What is your research question?
- Pull together a team of support: librarians, computer programmers, statisticians are on campus and here to help.

It can be tricky to know which version of your work you can share.
It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works.
But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which?
Visit the [Which Version Can I Share? ](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/sharing)page for an overview of pre-prints, post-prints, publisher PDFs and for information on how to locate these records.

Your data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.
In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text.
PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.
Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.

The University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data.
However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist.
If you want or need to share your research data, one of these might be a good fit.
These repositories are also good places to find datasets for re-use.

Text analysis is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets.
It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.
It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.
This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.

##### Getting Started with text analysis
- What is your research question?
- Pull together a team of support: librarians, computer programmers, statisticians are on campus and here to help.

It can be tricky to know which version of your work you can share.
It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works.
But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which?
Visit the [Which Version Can I Share? ](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/sharing)page for an overview of pre-prints, post-prints, publisher PDFs and for information on how to locate these records.

Your data , text, or content must be machine readable and together in one place for the algorthims in any platform to work.
In other words, images like PNG or JPG will not work, so they must be OCRed or converted into text.
PDFs may work if the text is searchable within the document.
Here are a few tools for converting your data into the proper text format.

The University of South Carolina does not currently have a system-wide, long-term archiving option for research data.
However, many external disciplinary and general data repositories exist.
If you want or need to share your research data, one of these might be a good fit.
These repositories are also good places to find datasets for re-use.

Text analysis is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets.
It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.
It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.
This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.

##### Getting Started with text analysis
- What is your research question?
- Pull together a team of support: librarians, computer programmers, statisticians are on campus and here to help.

It can be tricky to know which version of your work you can share.
It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works.
But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which?
Visit the [Which Version Can I Share? ](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/sharing)page for an overview of pre-prints, post-prints, publisher PDFs and for information on how to locate these records.

Text analysis is a subset of data mining, using computational methodes to study natural languages as unstructured data sets.
It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.
It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.
This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.

##### Getting Started with text analysis
- What is your research question?
- Pull together a team of support: librarians, computer programmers, statisticians are on campus and here to help.

It can be tricky to know which version of your work you can share.
It's always a good idea to pay attention to your publication agreements, because they'll tell you exactly how you can legally share your works.
But what if you don't have those agreements, or if you aren't sure which version is which?
Visit the [Which Version Can I Share? ](https://guides.library.sc.edu/scholarcommons/sharing)page for an overview of pre-prints, post-prints, publisher PDFs and for information on how to locate these records.

It can allow you to explore connections between words and topics.
It can be large blocks of text, not in a table or database.
This research method is increasing in use, but should not be done alone.

##### Getting Started with text analysis

A machine is said to be "learning" if its performance or efficiency for a given task improves with the experience (past data).
Machine Learning uses advanced algorithms to analyze and learn relationships between the data to make intelligent decisions on what it has learned.
The algorithms use a large amount of data to find the relationship.
This relationship is called a which is used to make useful predictions or generate content from the data.
