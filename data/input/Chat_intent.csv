How do I search South Caroliniana Library's collections?,"To search the South Caroliniana Library's collections, please start with our online catalog, which can be found on our [main webpage](http://sc.edu/libraries/scl).
To search by keyword, enter keywords in the search box and click search. Or, you can follow the link below the search box to [Advanced Search](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01PASCAL_USCCOL:USC&mode=advanced). There you will be able to search specific fields within the catalog records and build searches with AND, OR, or NOT.
In your first results page, you may limit your results further to physical and digital items held by University Libraries, including South Caroliniana Library, by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the search box where it says Articles, Books and More, choosing USC Libraries, and clicking the magnifying glass search icon to refresh your results. Then, if you wish to limit specifically to items within South Caroliniana Library's collections, click the checkboxes to choose all locations that have South Caroliniana as part of their name under the Location menu (at the left of the screen on a computer or under the filters icon on your phone). This may not seem intuitive, but choosing locations containing South Caroliniana returns a complete set of South Caroliniana Library materials, while choosing South Caroliniana Library under Library does not always return a complete set.
There might be materials within [South Carolina Political Collections](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/sc_political_collections/index.php) or [Oral History](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/oral_history/index.php) related to your topic as well. To include these in your catalog search results, please choose South Carolina Political Collections or Columbia Oral History as locations. Note, if there are no search results within these locations, the option to select them will not appear.
To point out a particular collection or item in a collection found in our catalog, we recommend including the Permalink. From the catalog record, click the PERMALINK icon under Tools. Then copy and paste the link into your email.

I have African American ancestry. Do you have suggestions for researching my genealogy?,"First, please take a look at [Do you have resources I can use to research my family's genealogy?](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/scl/faq/372588)
Here are some additional suggestions.
Past records of the [United States Census are available through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/census). The 1870 census is the first in which formerly enslaved African Americans were listed by name. The 1850 and 1860 censuses included slave schedules listing numbers of enslaved persons held by particular enslavers along with their sex, color (black or mulatto), and age, but without their names.
If you are able to determine the name of a plantation, family, or person who may have held an ancestor of yours in enslavement, you can look to see if South Caroliniana Library holds antebellum papers from that person, family, or plantation, which might include names of enslaved persons. We also hold series A and B of the Records of ante-bellum Southern Plantations on microfilm. (These are available also from [other libraries](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12894903).) We can provide an index to these records, or you can see the lists of names in the two series, [Series A](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/564176) and [Series B](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/559181), as provided by FamilySearch.org.
Records kept by the Freedmen's Bureau after the Civil War often contain labor contracts between recently-freed African Americans and land owners, who were sometimes their former enslavers. They are organized by area, so if you have an idea of where a formerly enslaved ancestor may have lived, you might be able to find a record of them from immediately after the Civil War. Freedmen's Bureau records are available several places online:
[The Freedmen's Bureau holdings at the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/freedmens-bureau)

Parking meter cards valid for one full day at any USC meter are available for $5 at the Parking and Transportation Services office on the ground level at the southeast corner of the Pendleton Street Garage. Payment at USC meters is not monitored on Saturday. Note, meters on the street are not University meters, but are maintained by the City of Columbia.
For more information on University parking, visit [Parking and Transportation Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/parking/index.php).
City of Columbia parking
[Parking monitored by the City of Columbia](https://parking.columbiasc.gov/) is available on surrounding streets at two-hour green meters and five-hour blue meters for 25 cents per 20 minutes, or with the Passport Parking app using your smart phone as explained [here](https://parking.columbiasc.gov/enforcement/).

Five-hour blue meters are on the south side of College, on Sumter between Greene and Pendleton, on Pendleton between Sumter and Bull, and on Senate between Marion and Bull.

Other parking
There is a state employee parking lot at the [corner of Pendleton and Marion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BipFrGWJo8aY77KN7). The signage indicates that parking is restricted to state employees by law / 6:00 A.M. - 6:00 P.M. Mon - Fri / no public parking. Many patrons report parking here on Saturdays without consequence; but given the ambiguity in the signage, we advise proceeding at your own risk.
Parking for people who have a disability
Persons with valid parking placards or license plates for people with disabilities may park in any street metered spaces maintained by the City of Columbia without feeding the meter and without time restrictions.
To park in accessible spaces marked as USC permit-only parking lots or garages, a USC permit, in conjunction with a state issued-placard is required. State-issued placards or plates alone are not valid to park in these spaces.
The visitor parking spaces in the Pendleton Street Garage include accessible parking spaces that may be used by those with state-issued placards or plates. These spaces are not marked as USC-permit only, but may require payment. However, please note there is an approximately 0.4 mile distance between the garage and South Caroliniana Library building.

"What was the Carolina/Southern California trademark dispute about, and does it affect the UofSC/USC branding?","The 2010 trademark case between the University of South Carolina and the University of Southern California was not over the use of USC. It was over the use of the interlocking SC letters as an athletic logo.
Southern California uses an interlocking block SC for its athletic teams, while South Carolina uses an interlocking script SC, which was based on historical designs over a century old. Southern California argued that fans would be confused by a burgundy block SC and a garnet script SC. The University Archives provided documentation of the historical usage of the interlocking SC at the University of South Carolina, but Southern California won the case because in the 1980s the longstanding usage of SC and South Carolina to represent this university were dropped in favor of using USC (and The USC). The judge ruled we had abandoned the mark. Carolina can still use the logo, it just can't be trademarked.

Why is there a charge on my card for more than the cost of my print job?,"Using Student Printing Kiosks:
When using a credit or debit card on Student Printing Kiosks, you first choose an authorization amount to cover your printing costs. This will put a temporary charge on your card that will expire. If the charge shows as Pending or Processing with your bank, that is not a posted charge, and you can expect it to be removed or refunded. You should see a separate charge for the actual cost of your printing.
Bank Policies:
Depending on the policies of your specific bank, it can take anywhere from 1 to 8 business days for authorization holds to expire. You can contact them to see if they can tell you what to expect. If having these holds on your debit card is not convenient, you may consider keeping a small balance of CarolinaCash to use instead for low-cost print jobs.
Request a Refund:
You must wait until a Pending or Processing charge posts to your account to request a refund. If a charge posts to your account that is incorrect, or you have other issues with Student Printing Kiosks, fill out the online help form below.
