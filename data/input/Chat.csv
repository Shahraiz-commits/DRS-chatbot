How do I search South Caroliniana Library's collections?,"To search the South Caroliniana Library's collections, please start with our online catalog, which can be found on our [main webpage](http://sc.edu/libraries/scl).

Or, you can follow the link below the search box to [Advanced Search](https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01PASCAL_USCCOL:USC&mode=advanced). There you will be able to search specific fields within the catalog records and build searches with AND, OR, or NOT.
In your first results page, you may limit your results further to physical and digital items held by University Libraries, including South Caroliniana Library, by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the search box where it says Articles, Books and More, choosing USC Libraries, and clicking the magnifying glass search icon to refresh your results. Then, if you wish to limit specifically to items within South Caroliniana Library's collections, click the checkboxes to choose all locations that have South Caroliniana as part of their name under the Location menu (at the left of the screen on a computer or under the filters icon on your phone). This may not seem intuitive, but choosing locations containing South Caroliniana returns a complete set of South Caroliniana Library materials, while choosing South Caroliniana Library under Library does not always return a complete set.
There might be materials within [South Carolina Political Collections](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/sc_political_collections/index.php) or [Oral History](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/browse/oral_history/index.php) related to your topic as well.

I have African American ancestry. Do you have suggestions for researching my genealogy?,"First, please take a look at [Do you have resources I can use to research my family's genealogy?](https://libanswers.library.sc.edu/scl/faq/372588)
Here are some additional suggestions.
Past records of the [United States Census are available through the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/census). The 1870 census is the first in which formerly enslaved African Americans were listed by name. The 1850 and 1860 censuses included slave schedules listing numbers of enslaved persons held by particular enslavers along with their sex, color (black or mulatto), and age, but without their names.
If you are able to determine the name of a plantation, family, or person who may have held an ancestor of yours in enslavement, you can look to see if South Caroliniana Library holds antebellum papers from that person, family, or plantation, which might include names of enslaved persons. We also hold series A and B of the Records of ante-bellum Southern Plantations on microfilm. (These are available also from [other libraries](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12894903).) We can provide an index to these records, or you can see the lists of names in the two series, [Series A](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/564176) and [Series B](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/559181), as provided by FamilySearch.org.
Records kept by the Freedmen's Bureau after the Civil War often contain labor contracts between recently-freed African Americans and land owners, who were sometimes their former enslavers. They are organized by area, so if you have an idea of where a formerly enslaved ancestor may have lived, you might be able to find a record of them from immediately after the Civil War. Freedmen's Bureau records are available several places online:
[The Freedmen's Bureau holdings at the National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/freedmens-bureau)

Other parking
There is a state employee parking lot at the [corner of Pendleton and Marion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BipFrGWJo8aY77KN7). The signage indicates that parking is restricted to state employees by law / 6:00 A.M. - 6:00 P.M. Mon - Fri / no public parking. Many patrons report parking here on Saturdays without consequence; but given the ambiguity in the signage, we advise proceeding at your own risk.

"What was the Carolina/Southern California trademark dispute about, and does it affect the UofSC/USC branding?","The 2010 trademark case between the University of South Carolina and the University of Southern California was not over the use of USC. It was over the use of the interlocking SC letters as an athletic logo.
Southern California uses an interlocking block SC for its athletic teams, while South Carolina uses an interlocking script SC, which was based on historical designs over a century old. Southern California argued that fans would be confused by a burgundy block SC and a garnet script SC. The University Archives provided documentation of the historical usage of the interlocking SC at the University of South Carolina, but Southern California won the case because in the 1980s the longstanding usage of SC and South Carolina to represent this university were dropped in favor of using USC (and The USC). The judge ruled we had abandoned the mark. Carolina can still use the logo, it just can't be trademarked.

Why is there a charge on my card for more than the cost of my print job?,"Using Student Printing Kiosks:
When using a credit or debit card on Student Printing Kiosks, you first choose an authorization amount to cover your printing costs. This will put a temporary charge on your card that will expire. If the charge shows as Pending or Processing with your bank, that is not a posted charge, and you can expect it to be removed or refunded. You should see a separate charge for the actual cost of your printing.
Bank Policies:
Depending on the policies of your specific bank, it can take anywhere from 1 to 8 business days for authorization holds to expire. You can contact them to see if they can tell you what to expect. If having these holds on your debit card is not convenient, you may consider keeping a small balance of CarolinaCash to use instead for low-cost print jobs.
Request a Refund:
You must wait until a Pending or Processing charge posts to your account to request a refund. If a charge posts to your account that is incorrect, or you have other issues with Student Printing Kiosks, fill out the online help form below.

What is the difference between data and statistics?,"## Data vs Statistics
is raw information from which statistics are created.
provides a summary and interpretation of the data.

#### Data
- Datasets

- Machine-readable data files, data files for statistical software programs

If you want to understand a phenomenon, you want data. Data can be analyzed and interpreted using statistical procedures to answer why or how. Data is used to create new information and knowledge.
Raw data is the direct result of research that was conducted as part of a study or survey. It is a primary source. It usually comes in the form of a digital data set that can be analyzed using software such as Excel, , , and so on. This is what a data set looks like:

#### Statistics
- Statistical tables, charts, and graphs

- Reported numbers and percentages in an article

If you’re looking for a quick number, you want a statistic. A statistic will answer how much or how many. A statistic repeats a pre-defined observation about reality.
Statistics are the results of data analysis. It usually comes in the form of a table or chart. This is what a statistical table looks like:

What is open data?,"#### Open data is data that is freely available for use or distribution by anyone. It is research data that:
- Is freely available on the internet;
- Permits any user to download, copy, analyze, re-process, pass to software or use for any other purpose; and
- Is without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access ot the internet
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Copyright SPARC

## Why Use Open Data?
Open data is important because it:
- . When datasets are openly available, they can be easily accessed and used to create a fuller picture of a given area of inquiry, or analyzed by data mining software that can uncover connections not apparent to those who produce the original data.
- . Researchers estimate that $3.2 trillion in economic output could be added to global GDP through Open Data across all sectors, with scientific and scholarly data playing an important role. [1]
- . There are a huge number of ways to use or analyze any given dataset. What seems like noise to one person could be an important discovery to someone else with a different perspective or analytical technique.
- . When the data that underlies findings is accessible, researchers can check each other's work and ensure that conclusions are built upon a firm foundation.
- From research funders like the US government to publishers, institutions involved in the research process are beginning to require that, at the very least, the data that underlies publications be made openly accessible.

What is data visualization?,"## What is Data Visualization?
Data visualization is an umbrella term referring to the representation of raw data content in a graphic or pictorial manner. Related concepts include information visualization and scientific visualization. Using visual features of encoded data such as position, size, shape, hue and saturation, motion, etc., data visualization applies tools and techniques to communicate the raw data in visual form.
Common examples include charts, graphs, timelines, maps, and even tables."
Why is data visualization important?,"
## Why Visualize Data?
Raw data and statistics can often appear confusing. Many research data sets are going to be overwhelming in size. Data visualization applies what we know about human perception to optimize cognition, making it easier to understand, interpret, and analyze patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Use of effective data visualization if often focused on one of two primary purposes:
- sometimes referred to as sense-making or data analysis. Using visualization techniques to examine and discover trends, associations, outliers, etc., that may not be obvious when viewing the raw data.
- also referred to as storytelling or communication. Creating visualizations that make understanding what the data is saying clearer and more obvious.
Successful data visualization relies on selecting the appropriate tool, technique, and visual expression that most effectively presents the story the data is telling. Data visualization should be considered a means to an end, not an end in itself."
What is the data science lifecycle?,"
## The Data Science Lifecycle
Data visualization is one component of a much broader data analytics life cycle. While there is some variation in defining the full data analytics life cycle, the graphic below presents a general structure encompassing the basic components."
What are some common terms used in data visualization?,"
## Terminology
When discussing data visualization, various related terms may be used somewhat loosely. The following is a very brief glossary of commonly used data terminology:
- A process of building, cleaning, and structuring datasets for the purpose of analysis and extraction of meaning.
- Analysis of data to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights.
- techniques using geographic, topological,  or geometric properties to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights
- ...refers to a variety of processes designed to transform raw data into more readily used formats.

What are the guidelines for creating effective visualizations?,"## Guidelines for Effective Visualizations
- Know and understand your audience
- Make sure to clearly identify what you are seeking to communicate
- Adapt the visualization to the strengths of the medium and vice-versa
- Captions are essential
- Default settings should not assumed to be optimal
- Color should be used selectively and effectively
- Be careful not to inadvertently mislead your audience
- Simple is good. Avoid Chartjunk.
- Image is not everything. The goal is effective comprehension and communication, not the most impressive visualization.
- Use the best tool

- Roles and Responsibilities
- Types of Data
- Data Formats and Metadata
- Access, Sharing, and Privacy
- Policies and Provisions for Re-use and Re-Distribution
- Data Storage and Preservation"
Why do I need a Data Management Plan (DMP)?,"In 2013, the US Office of Science and Technology issued a policy memorandum expanding requirements for planning and sharing of data. Most federal funding research agencies require DMPs as part of the grant application process.
Even if you don't need to meet funder requirements, data management plans are still valuable. Planning ahead of time for the storage, backup, archiving, and sharing (if applicable) of data will:
- Save time and effort down the road
- Enhance the value and usefulness of data long-term
- Increase research efficiency"
Is there a tool to help me create a Data Management Plan (DMP)?,"Available at [dmptool.org](http://dmptool.org), DMPTool is a free tool to help researchers create data management plans that comply with funder requirements. It walks users through the components required by the funder they're applying to, and allows them to create a completed DMP, which can be exported as a Word document or PDF.

Why do I need a data management plan?,"Creating a plan to manage and store your data throughout its lifecycle is a critical component of the research process. Not only does having a data management plan save you time and resources, but is a requirement for grant applications for many major funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). In addition, having a plan to manage your data promotes increased data sharing, transparency, and reproducibility.

What is metadata?,"Metadata is information about the context, content, quality, provenance, and/or accessibility of a dataset. In order for your data to be accessible to you, your colleagues, and other researchers, it must be properly documented. Put simply, metadata is data about your data."
Why is metadata important?,"Data often have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them. Researchers may continue to work on data after funding has ceased, follow-up projects may analyse or add to the data, and data may be re-used by other researchers. Well organised, well documented, preserved and shared data are invaluable to advance scientific inquiry and to increase opportunities for learning and innovation.
--[Create and Manage Data, the UK Data Archive](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/life-cycle)"
What should I include in my metadata?,"- Make a note of all file names and formats associated with the project, how the data are organized, how the data were generated (including any equipment or software used), and information about how the data have been altered or processed.
- Include an explanation of codes, abbreviations, or variables used in the data or in the file naming structure.
- Keep notes about where you got the data so that you and others can find it."
What are the elements of metadata?,"- Name of the dataset or research project that produced it
- Names and addresses of the organization or people who created the data
- Number used to identify the data, even if it is just an internal project reference number
- Keywords or phrases describing the subject or content of the data
- Organizations or agencies who funded the research
- Any known intellectual property rights held for the data
- Where and how your data can be accessed by other researchers
- Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource, when applicable
- Key dates associated with the data, including: project start and end date; release date; time period covered by the data; and other dates associated with the data lifespan, e.g., maintenance cycle updated schedule
- Where the data relates to a physical location, record information about its spatial coverage
- How the data were generated, including equipment or software used, experimental protocol, other things one might include in a lab notebook
- Along the way, record any information on how the data have been altered or processed
- Citations to material for data derived from other sources, including details of where the source data is held and how it was accessed
- List of all data files associated with the project, with their names and file extensions (e.g. 'NWPalaceTR.WRL', 'stone.mov')
- Format(s) of the data, e.g. FITS, SPSS, HTML, JPEG, and any software required to read the data
- Organization of the data file(s) and the layout of the variables, when applicable"
Where can I find more information about metadata standards?,"- A directory of [Disciplinary Metadata](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards) standards is available from the UK's Digital Curation Centre. This site is browseable by discipline.
- For a visualization of the wider metadata universe most often used in the humanities, see Jenn Riley's [Seeing Standards](http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/).
- The [Metadata Standard Glossary](http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/seeingstandards_glossary_pamphlet.pdf) provides additional description for each of the standards listed.
- The Digital Library Federation has a wiki for [best practices for shareable metadata](http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/index.php/ShareableMetadataPublic).

Where can I learn more about metadata?,[Learn more here](https://guides.library.sc.edu/c.php?g=592274&p=4095612)
Why is a consistent file naming strategy important?,"Developing and following a consistent file naming strategy can make data easier to find, particularly when large numbers of files exist. Although it's common to think that file names will be remembered in the future, unorganized files and folders can lead to frustration down the road.

Good file naming allows you to identify the contents of the file from the name. It may be useful to consider including some or all of the following information, as long as it is done consistently.
- File creator's name/initials
- Date of creation
- Version number
- Project or experiment name or acronym
- Location/spatial coordinates
- Type of data
- Conditions
- File version number
- Keep file names as short as possible while including necessary information.
- Do not use special characters such as #, <, >, $, +, %, *, etc. Different operating systems may interpret these as instructions to perform special tasks.
- Use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_), full stops (.), or spaces in file names.
- If you add dates, make sure you use consistent formatting.
- While underscores are invisible when links are underlined, hyphens can still be seen.
- For files that might be searched online, some search engines don't recognize underscores and others may downgrade page rankings if underscores are used.

What file formats should I use to ensure long-term accessibility of research data?,"As anyone with data saved on a floppy disk probably realizes, technology changes constantly and, if not planned for, hardware and software obsolescence can render data inaccessible and unreadable. To ensure long-term accessibility of research data, researchers should consider using file formats that share these characteristics:
- Non-proprietary
- Open, documented standard
- Common usage by research community
- Standard representation ([ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com/),[Unicode](http://unicode.org/))
- Unencrypted
- Uncompressed

Data saved in proprietary formats are vulnerable to obsolescence. Here are examples of open file formats you can use to increase the likelihood that research data will be accessible in the future. A number of applications have been developed to open these types of files:
- instead of a Microsoft Word extension (.doc, .docx)
- instead of a Microsoft Excel extension (.xls, .xlsx)
- TIFF or[JPEG2000](https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/)instead of .gif or .jpg

What is Open Science Framework?,"[](https://osf.io/institutions/sc/) is an online research collaboration tool and data repository. Created by the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/), OSF allows researchers to collaborate, document, archive, share, and register research projects, materials, and data.

Open Science Framework is not just for science! Researchers in any discipline can use this tool. Keep in mind that OSF is for sensitive data."
How do I get started with Open Science Framework?,"- [Create an Account](https://osf.io/register/)

- [USC OSF Dashboard](https://osf.io/institutions/sc)"
What type of data should not be stored in Open Science Framework?,"## Not for PII, PHI
Open Science Framework is not HIPAA-compliant. It is not a place to store data sets containing personally identifiable information.

[Learn more here](http://guides.library.sc.edu/osf)"
Why is backing up data important?,"Backing up data is an essential part of the data management process. Hardware failure, virus infection, hacking, and loss or theft of hardware are all common realities that can have a devastating effect on research if proper back-up hasn't taken place. See the [UK Data Archive's guidelines on Backing-up Data](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/store.aspx) for more information.

Back-up and storage are related concepts, but are not the same thing. While storage refers to ways of preserving files for the short- or long-term, back-up refers to preserving copies of your files in different physical locations and using different media to protect against data loss."
What is a good rule of thumb for backing up data?,"A good rule of thumb for backing up data is the 3-2-1 rule. It states that at least 3 total copies of data should exist, 2 of which are local but on different media (devices), and at least 1 copy should be stored offsite. The offsite storage is important in case of fires, floods, or theft."
What is the difference between information security and privacy?,"While information security is concerned with protection, privacy is concerned with the sensitivity of data, the justification for collecting data, and decisions about notification and sharing. International, Federal, and State legislation and regulations may apply. Privacy issues vary greatly by location and subject matter of data, posing significant liabilities, especially with regard to protected personal information (PPI) and personal identifying information (PII)."
